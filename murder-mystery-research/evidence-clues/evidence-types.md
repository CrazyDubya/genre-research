## Fair Play Principles

### Ronald Knox's Ten Commandments (1929)

1. The criminal must be mentioned in the early part of the story, but must not be anyone whose thoughts the reader has shared.
2. All supernatural or preternatural agencies are ruled out.
3. No secret rooms or hidden passages.
4. No hitherto undiscovered poisons.
5. No Chinaman (no stereotypical exotic villains).
6. No accident must ever help the detective.
7. The detective must not himself commit the crime.
8. The detective must find all clues in plain sight.
9. The detective's friend (the Watson) must not conceal any thoughts.
10. Identical twins and doubles must not appear.
