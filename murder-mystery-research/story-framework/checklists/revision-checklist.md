## Developmental Edit Toolkit

### Developmental Edit Checklist
- [ ] Pacing map created (fast/slow alternation)
- [ ] Tension curve visible with rises and releases
- [ ] Stakes escalate at every major turning point
- [ ] Theme statement articulated in one sentence
- [ ] Key scenes reinforce theme (no thematic drift)
- [ ] Character arcs align with theme and stakes
- [ ] Subplots either serve theme or are removed

### Chapter/Scene Review Prompts (Plot + Tension)
For each chapter/scene/section, answer:
- What changes in story state by the end?
- How does it advance or complicate the main plot?
- What new question or uncertainty does it create?
- Where does it land on the tension curve (rise, peak, release)?
- How do stakes shift (higher, more personal, more urgent)?
- What is the reader's emotional beat?
- Is there a clear hook or propulsive end?

### Restructuring Tools
- [ ] Reorder scenes to improve cause-and-effect or escalation
- [ ] Merge adjacent scenes that repeat information
- [ ] Split overloaded scenes into distinct beats
- [ ] Remove scenes that do not change story state
- [ ] Replace exposition-only scenes with active conflict
- [ ] Insert bridging beats to smooth gaps after cuts

### Theme Tracker (Motif/Alignment View)
| Theme/Motif | Key appearances (chapter/scene) | Character/plot link | Alignment notes | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | |

### Approval Gate: Before Line Edit
Proceed to line-level editing only when:
- [ ] Structural issues resolved (plot holes, order, missing beats)
- [ ] Pacing and tension curve reviewed and adjusted
- [ ] Stakes escalation verified across the story
- [ ] Theme tracker filled and alignment confirmed
- [ ] Restructuring actions completed
- [ ] Feedback incorporated (beta/editor notes, if available)
