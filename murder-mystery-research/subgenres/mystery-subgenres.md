## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Wrong Tone for Subgenre

**Problem:** Cozy mystery with graphic violence or hardboiled with cute charm.

**Solution:** Understand subgenre conventions and stick to them (or deliberately subvert).

### Mistake 2: Mixing Without Signaling

**Problem:** Blend subgenres without establishing expectations, confusing readers.

**Solution:** Signal the blend early (title, cover description, opening chapters establish tone).

### Mistake 3: Breaking Core Conventions

**Problem:** Locked room with supernatural explanation. Inverted mystery where reader doesn't know killer.

**Solution:** Understand core element of subgenre and respect it (unless explicitly deconstructing).

### Mistake 4: Amateur Detective in Wrong Setting

**Problem:** Cozy amateur detective investigates serial killer thriller (tonal clash).

**Solution:** Match detective type to subgenre (amateur = cozy, professional = procedural/hardboiled).

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Respect Reader Expectations

**Subgenre establishes contract with reader.**

Deliver what they expect:
- Cozy readers want charm and puzzle, not graphic violence
- Hardboiled readers want grit and moral ambiguity, not cute charm
- Police procedural readers want realism, not supernatural

- Hardboiled: Cynicism and moral ambiguity
- Police Procedural: Realistic methods
- Inverted: Dramatic irony (reader knows)
- Locked Room: Impossible puzzle
- Historical: Period authenticity
- Psychological: Motivation and depth
- Thriller: Pacing and danger

**Build your mystery around this core element.**

### 3. Use Subgenre to Guide All Choices

**Subgenre affects:**

- Hardboiled: Professional, damaged
- Police Procedural: Team, department

**Resolution:**
- Cozy: Justice restored, community heals

- Psychological: Emotional resolution as important as justice

### 4. Know When to Blend

**Blend for originality, not confusion.**

**Good reasons to blend:**
- Fresh take on familiar type
- Specific story needs both elements
- You understand both subgenres well

**Bad reasons to blend:**
- Can't commit to one type
- Want "everything" (unfocused)
- Don't understand subgenre conventions

### 5. Signal Subgenre Clearly

**Help readers know what to expect:**

**Title:** Cozy titles sound cozy ("Murder at the Bake Sale"). Hardboiled titles sound gritty ("Blood on the Moon").

**Opening:** Establish tone immediately (first chapter sets reader expectations).

**Description:** Jacket copy, Amazon description clearly identifies subgenre.

**Cover:** Visuals signal subgenre (cozy covers look different than hardboiled covers).
