- She met his eyes despite her fear
- He let himself remember

**Trust:**
- She told him what she'd never said
- He held her while she cried
- She left the door unlocked (metaphorically)
- He showed her his scars

**Love:**
- "I choose you, every time"
- She put his needs before her own fear
- He couldn't imagine life without her
- They made each other better
