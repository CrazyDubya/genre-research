# Relationship Development: Chemistry and Intimacy

## The 12 Stages of Intimacy

Based on the model by physical therapist and author:

1. **Eye to Body** - Noticing physical appearance
2. **Eye to Eye** - First meaningful eye contact
3. **Voice to Voice** - First conversation
4. **Hand to Hand** - First touch (handshake, hand-holding)
5. **Arm to Shoulder** - Closer physical proximity
6. **Arm to Waist** - More intimate contact
7. **Face to Face** - Close intimate moments

9. **Hand to Body** - Full body exploration
10. **Mouth to Breast** - Increasingly intimate
11. **Hand to Genitals** - Sexual intimacy
12. **Genitals to Genitals** - Full sexual union
