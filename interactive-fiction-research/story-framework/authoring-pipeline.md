# Interactive Fiction Authoring Pipeline

**Use this guide to coordinate your writing workflow from idea capture to final chapters.**

## Core Modules

### 1. Idea Vault
**Purpose:** Capture raw concepts, hooks, and prompts without judging feasibility.

**Inputs:**
- Brainstormed seeds (themes, settings, conflicts, mechanics)
- Inspiration clips (references, images, quotes)
- Player fantasies (emotions, experiences, genre beats)

**Outputs / Artifacts:**
- Idea backlog (tagged list of concepts)
- Pitch cards (one-paragraph summaries)
- Prioritized shortlist for outlining

---

### 2. Outline Builder
**Purpose:** Convert selected ideas into structured story architecture.

**Inputs:**
- Shortlisted ideas from the Idea Vault
- Desired scope (playtime, room count, puzzle depth)
- Genre expectations and target audience

**Outputs / Artifacts:**
- **Outline schema** (acts/regions → scenes/rooms → beats/puzzles)
- Progression map (gates, dependencies, critical path)
- Narrative pacing plan (revelations and major turns)

---

### 3. Chapter Drafting
**Purpose:** Produce playable content with prose, interactions, and state changes.

**Inputs:**
- Outline schema and progression map
- Character sheets and world rules
- Style guide (voice, tense, formatting)

**Outputs / Artifacts:**
- Chapter/room drafts
- Interaction scripts (commands, choices, responses)
- Puzzle logic notes and test cases

---

### 4. Canon Manager
**Purpose:** Maintain consistency across lore, world rules, and continuity.

**Inputs:**
- Draft content from Chapter Drafting
- Updates discovered during development
- Feedback from test reads

**Outputs / Artifacts:**
- Canon ledger (facts, dates, locations, tech/magic rules)
- Character sheets (bio, motives, dialogue rules)
- Worldbuilding bible (terminology, tone, constraints)

---

## Inputs, Outputs, and Data Artifacts

| Module | Inputs | Outputs / Artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Idea Vault | Raw concepts, inspirations, player fantasies | Idea backlog, pitch cards, shortlist |
| Outline Builder | Shortlisted ideas, scope, genre goals | Outline schema, progression map, pacing plan |
| Chapter Drafting | Outline schema, character sheets, style guide | Draft chapters/rooms, interaction scripts, puzzle notes |
| Canon Manager | Draft content, feedback, updates | Canon ledger, character sheets, worldbuilding bible |

## Inter-Module Dependencies & Transitions

1. **Idea Vault → Outline Builder**
   - Select top pitches and define scope constraints.
   - Output: Outline schema draft.

2. **Outline Builder → Chapter Drafting**
   - Break outline into chapter/room tasks.
   - Output: Draft content aligned to beats and puzzle gates.

3. **Chapter Drafting → Canon Manager**
   - Log new facts, rules, and continuity decisions.
   - Output: Updated canon ledger and character sheets.

4. **Canon Manager → Outline Builder / Chapter Drafting (Feedback Loop)**
   - Enforce continuity, adjust outline beats, and update drafts.
   - Output: Revised outline or draft revisions.

## Persistent Knowledge Base Sidebar

**Purpose:** A dedicated, always-visible panel that centralizes canon, worldbuilding, and style guidance so every module stays aligned.

**Sidebar Contents:**
- **Canon ledger:** facts, timelines, and invariants
- **Worldbuilding bible:** locations, factions, systems, terminology
- **Character sheets:** motivations, dialogue rules, secrets
- **Style guide:** voice, tense, POV, formatting conventions
- **Glossary:** proper nouns and recurring motifs

**Usage Across Modules:**
- **Idea Vault:** tag new ideas with canon compatibility or deviations.
- **Outline Builder:** verify beats against world rules and timeline.
- **Chapter Drafting:** reference tone, POV, and dialogue rules while writing.
- **Canon Manager:** update entries as new truths are established.

---

## Suggested Workflow

1. Capture ideas in the **Idea Vault**.
2. Select and structure them in **Outline Builder**.
3. Draft scenes/rooms in **Chapter Drafting**.
4. Record new truths in **Canon Manager**.
5. Iterate using the **Knowledge Base Sidebar** as the shared source of truth.
