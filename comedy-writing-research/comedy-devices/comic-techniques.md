# Comedy Devices and Techniques

## The Comic Toolbox

### 1. Incongruity

**The Core Comic Device:**
- Expectation vs. Reality
- Setup creates one expectation
- Punchline delivers different reality
- The gap creates laughter

**Types:**
- **Verbal Incongruity:** Wrong word used
- **Situational Incongruity:** Wrong outcome
- **Character Incongruity:** Behavior doesn't match situation
- **Visual Incongruity:** Image clashes with context

**Example:**
"I intend to live forever. So far, so good."
- Setup: Living forever (impossible)
- Punchline: "So far, so good" (undermines grandiosity)

### 2. Exaggeration (Hyperbole)

**Making Small Things Huge:**
- Take truth to ridiculous extreme
- Everyday problems become catastrophes
- Normal flaws become monstrous
- Relatable because we all do this

**Examples:**
- "I'm so hungry I could eat a horse"
- "This is the WORST day of my life"
- "I've been waiting forever" (5 minutes)

**Functions:**
- Heightens stakes
- Expresses emotion through exaggeration
- Makes frustration funny
- Universal experience

### 3. The Rule of Three

**Classic Comic Pattern:**
- First instance: establishes pattern
- Second instance: reinforces pattern
- Third instance: breaks pattern (punchline)

**Examples:**
- Knock-knock jokes
- Three attempts at something
- Three examples
- The twist comes on third

**Why It Works:**
- Creates anticipation
- Establishes expectation
- Third time provides surprise
- Satisfying rhythm

### 4. Misunderstanding

**Comic Confusion:**
- Character takes things literally
- Misinterprets situation
- Wrong conclusion reached
- Hilarity ensues

**Types:**
- **Literal Interpretation:** Idioms taken literally
- **Context Confusion:** Wrong setting understood
- **Mistaken Identity:** Wrong person assumed
- **Eavesdropping:** Hearing only part of conversation

**Example:**
"I can't believe you ate my sandwich!"
"It said 'For You' on it!"
'That's because it said 'For You, Chris'"

### 5. Repetition and Callback

**Recurring Jokes:**
- Joke referenced multiple times
- Gets funnier each time
- Builds on itself
- Creates continuity

**The Callback:**
- Reference earlier joke
- Later in story
- Brings back comic premise
- Bigger laugh due to familiarity

**Running Gag:**
- Repeated joke or situation
- Each time slightly different
- Escalates or evolves
- Finally resolved or paid off

### 6. Irony

**Situational Irony:**
- Outcome opposite of expectation
- Result contradicts intention

**Dramatic Irony:**

### 9. Wordplay and Puns

### The Anti-Joke

**Subverting Expectation:**

- Audience expects punchline

**Example:**
"Setup: Why did the boy drop his ice cream?"
"Punchline: Because he was hit by a bus."
(Shock humor, not traditional joke)

## Misdirection

- **Assumption:** Let audience assume

## Escalation

## Testing Comedy

### What Makes It Work

**Is It Funny?**
- Test with audience
- Revise based on response
- Cut what doesn't work
- Enhance what does

**Truth:**
- Is there truth?
- Is it relatable?
- Does it say something real?
- Do we recognize ourselves?

**Surprise:**
- Is it unexpected?
- Does it subvert expectation?
- Is the twist clever?
- Not predictable

**Recognition:**
- Do we recognize this?
- Have we felt this?
- Is this familiar?
- "That's so true!"

**Remember:** Comedy devices are tools, not ends in themselves. The best comedy uses these techniques in service of truth, character, and emotion. Jokes without truth become empty; comedy without heart becomes hollow.
