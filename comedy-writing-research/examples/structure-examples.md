CHANDLER
So... you lost the girl, but you gained a whole lot of perspective.

MONICA
And a really great story for your next date.

ROSS
There is not going to be a next date.

Everyone makes skeptical faces.

ALL
(together/monotone)
"Yes there is."

(defeated)
I think there might be.

ACT ONE

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING

SARAH (30s, Type-A, over-prepared for everything) power-walks
down the street, on the phone, checking her watch, carrying three
coffees and a bagel in her teeth.

She's a mess. An adorable, put-together mess.

SARAH
(mumbling around bagel)
I need the spreadsheets by noon. No, I need them by eleven.
No, ten. I need everything ten minutes ago.

She rounds a corner and—

SMACK into MIKE (30s, laid-back, disorganized, charming).

Coffees everywhere. Bagel on the ground. Chaos.

SARAH
(aghast)
My spreadsheet! My coffee! My bagel!

MIKE
(apologetic, smiling)
My bad. I was distracted by... honestly, I have no idea.
The sky? The possibility of lunch?

SARAH
(recovering, annoyed)
You ruined my morning.

MIKE
(grinning)
On the bright side, you can't get more caffeinated than
wearing it.

Sarah stares. He's not wrong.

ON SARAH: Annoyed, but also... intrigued.

```

**Example Scene:** The "Not a Date" Date
```markdown
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Sarah and Mike at a nice restaurant. Awkward.

SARAH
This isn't a date.

MIKE
Totally not a date. We're two colleagues,
collegially sharing a meal.

SARAH
Exactly. Colleagues.

A WAITER appears.

WAITER
Table for two?

SARAH
Two separate checks. We're colleagues.

WAITER
(confused)
On a date?

SARAH
No!

MIKE
(smiling)
She wishes.

SARAH
(shooting him a look)
I do not wish.

MIKE
(to waiter)
She really wishes.

SARAH
(to Mike)
I wish you would stop talking.

They stare at each other. Sexual tension like crazy.

MIKE
I love when you talk hostile to me.

SARAH
(fighting smile)
Shut up.

MIKE
That's the spirit.

They smile. Actual moment. Then—

MIKE'S EX-GIRLFRIEND appears behind him. gorgeous, perfect.

EX
Mike! Is this your... date?

SARAH
NO.

MIKE
(sort of)
YES.

EX
(to Sarah)
He's great, isn't he? Just... great.

Sarah sees: Ex is perfect. Sarah is... Sarah.

SARAH
(to Ex)
He's... adequate.

Ex laughs. Mike laughs. Sarah doesn't laugh.

She checks her phone. Eleven new emails. Work emergency.

SARAH
I have to go. Work. Emergency. Colleague emergency.

She flees.

MIKE
(to himself)
Colleagues don't flee.

```

#### Midpoint: Falling in Like (50 minutes)
- **Comic moment of connection:** They actually have fun together
- **Vulnerability shown:** Real moment, no jokes
- **"Oh no, I like them":** Realization creates panic
- **Fun and games intensify:** More situations, higher stakes

**Comic Sequence Example:** The Karaoke Disaster
1. Karaoke bar chosen (neutral territory)
2. Mike sings surprisingly well
3. Sarah forced to sing, sings terribly
4. They bond over her terrible singing
5. Real moment: laughing together, genuine connection
6. Almost kiss (interrupted by comic complication)

#### Second Act: The Complication (75 minutes)
- **Black moment / Breakup:** Misunderstanding or real problem separates them

- **Realization:** They need to change / they belong together

**Example Breakup Scene:**
```markdown
INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The "it's not you, it's me" conversation, but
comic version.

SARAH
It's not you. It's me.

MIKE
That's literally what people say when it's the other person.

SARAH
I'm emotionally unavailable! I have workaholism!
I have commitment phobia! I have a spreadsheet
tracking this conversation!

MIKE
You have a what?

SARAH
(showing him)
It's a very detailed spreadsheet. Look, you can see
there's a clear trend of me messing up.

MIKE
(reads spreadsheet)
"You made a joke. I laughed. Then I panicked."

SARAH
That's accurate data!

MIKE
Sarah. You're not emotionally unavailable.
You're just... very available to work.

SARAH
I have a project due!

MIKE
You always have a project due! That's the thing!
Your work isn't the problem. Your work is the
symptom of the problem!

SARAH
What problem?

MIKE
The problem where you're terrified of being happy
because it might end!

Sarah stares. He's right. She hates that he's right.

SARAH
(quietly)
I should go.

MIKE
Yeah. You should.

Sarah leaves. Mike looks at the spreadsheet.
Writes one final entry:

"Mike made a point. I hated it. He was right."

```

#### Third Act: The Grand Gesture (90 minutes)
- **Rock bottom:** Protagonist at lowest point
- **Epiphany:** Realization they must change
- **Grand gesture:** Public or dramatic act to win back love
- **Obstacle to gesture:** Something goes wrong (comic)
- **Gesture succeeds anyway:** Because it's authentic

**Example Grand Gesture:** The Airport Race (Subverted)
1. Sarah rushes to airport to stop Mike
2. Comic complications: traffic, security, wrong terminal
3. She arrives disheveled, out of breath, gives speech
4. Mike reveals: he wasn't leaving, he was picking someone up
5. Speech was for nothing BUT it works because she showed up
6. Airport security asks her to leave (comic button)

**Example Scene:**
```markdown
INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Sarah runs through airport. Sweating. Panic. Romance
movie montage style.

She spots Mike at gate. He's... waiting. Holding a sign.

Sign reads: "SARAH."

She stops. Breathing hard.

SARAH
(confused)
You're not leaving?

MIKE
(smiling)
No. I'm picking up my niece. You're here
because you thought I was leaving?

SARAH
(defeated)
I made a whole speech. In my head. It was very
moving. There were parts about you being
"adequate."

MIKE
I bet "adequate" was great.

SARAH
I was going to say "great" but I didn't want to
scare you off.

MIKE
Too late. You scared me off three days ago.

SARAH
Then why do you have a sign?

MIKE
(grinning)
I was hoping you'd show up. Also, my niece's
name is Sarah. Very confusing.

Sarah stares. Then laughs.

SARAH
I hate you.

MIKE
No you don't.

SARAH
No. No, I don't.

SECURITY GUARD appears.

SECURITY GUARD
Ma'am, are you Sarah?

SARAH
Yes?

SECURITY GUARD
Then you can't be here. This sign is for other Sarah.
Sarah the niece.

SARAH
(to Security Guard)
I'm not a terrorist. I'm just romantically
misinformed.

MIKE
(to Security Guard)
It's okay. She's with me. She's just... very
dramatic.

SARAH
I made a spreadsheet!

MIKE
We know, honey. We know.

They kiss. Airport applauds. (Rom-com trope: strangers
always applaud at airports).

```

#### Resolution: HEA (100 minutes)
- **Relationship established:** They're together
- **Character grown:** Both have learned something
- **Comic callback:** Reference to earlier joke
- **Happy ending:** They're together, better people

**Final Scene Example:**
```markdown
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Sarah and Mike. Different coffee shop. They're holding hands.

SARAH
I made a new spreadsheet.

MIKE
Should I be scared?

SARAH
It's about us.

MIKE
Oh no.

SARAH
Positive trends only.

MIKE
Let me see.

She shows him. It's very detailed. "Held hands. +5.
Kissed. +10. Made fun of each other. +15."

MIKE
(grinning)
This is the worst spreadsheet I've ever seen.

SARAH
I also made one for work.

MIKE
Let me guess. "Missed deadline because was
too busy being happy"?

SARAH
Exactly.

MIKE
You're getting better at this.

SARAH
At what?

MIKE
Life.

SARAH
(smiling)
I have a really good teacher.

They kiss. Romantic music swells.

Then—

MIKE
Also, you still owe me for the coffee you spilled
on our first date.

SARAH
It wasn't a date!

MIKE
It was absolutely a date.

SARAH
Fine. I'll buy you coffee.

MIKE
For the rest of my life?

SARAH
(playfully)
Don't push it.

MIKE
I'm going to push it. I'm going to push it
every day for the rest of our lives.

SARAH
That sounds... exhausting.

MIKE
It's going to be great.

Freeze frame on their smiles.

FADE OUT.

THE END

```

## 3. Sketch Comedy Structure

### Example: "The Premise" Generic Sketch

**Total Length:** 3-5 minutes

#### Setup (30 seconds)
- **Premise established immediately:** What's the "game" of the sketch?
- **Normal world:** Establish baseline reality
- **Comic twist:** Introduce absurd element

**Example:**
```markdown
TITLE: " THE SUPPORT GROUP"

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - NIGHT

Circle of chairs. People sit. Serious support
group vibes.

LEADER (50s, earnest)
Welcome to... (checks notes) ...People Who
Accidentally Became Crime Lords Support Group.

Nods around the circle. Everyone relates.

LEADER
Who'd like to start?

```

#### Heightening (2-3 minutes)
- **First escalation:** Push the absurdity further
- **Second escalation:** Push it even further
- **Third escalation:** Maximum absurdity
- **Pattern established:** Rule of three

**Example Beat Sheet:**
1. First person shares story (funny but relatable)
   - "I was just selling girl scout cookies, next thing I know, I'm running protection rackets"
2. Second person tops it (escalation)
   - "I started a dog walking business. Now I control 40% of the city's waste management."
3. Third person goes absurd (maximum)
   - "I dropped my ice cream. I now own the cartel."
4. Pattern continues, each story more ridiculous
5. Leader tries to relate, reveals they're most criminal of all

#### Maximum Chaos (30 seconds)
- **Everything comes together:** All absurd elements collide
- **Break the pattern:** Subvert established pattern
- **Peak absurdity:** Most ridiculous moment

**Example:**
```markdown
LEADER
(emotional)
I think we can all agree... we never asked
for this life.

Everyone nods. Tissues come out.

LEADER
I know I didn't. I was just... trying to start
a community garden.

GROUP MEMBER
(sympathetic)
What happened?

LEADER
(ashamed)
I needed fertilizer. One thing led to another.
Now I manufacture 80% of the country's
methamphetamine.

Stunned silence.

GROUP MEMBER
But... the tomatoes...

LEADER
(shrugging)
They're very good tomatoes.

```

#### Punchline / Exit (30 seconds)
- **Callback to setup:** Reference opening premise
- **Final twist:** One last comic reversal
- **Quick exit:** Sketch ends before wearing out welcome

**Example:**
```markdown
LEADER
(continuing)
The point is... we can change.

Everyone: "Yes!"

LEADER
We can choose differently.

Everyone: "Yes!"

LEADER
Starting tomorrow.

Everyone: "YES!"

LEADER
Because tonight... (checks watch) ...we have that
thing.

GROUP MEMBER
The thing?

LEADER
The... (vague) ...thing. With the guys.

Realization dawns. They're all still criminals.

GROUP MEMBER
Right. The thing.

ALL
(disappointed but resigned)
See you next week.

They exit separately, all checking their phones,
clearly coordinating illegal activities.

FADE OUT.

```

## 4. Farce Structure (Scene Breakdown)

### Example: "The Door Slam" Generic Farce Scene

**Total Length:** 5 minutes

#### Setup (1 minute)
- **Normal situation:** People in room
- **Complication introduced:** Something must be hidden
- **First door slam:** Someone enters, chaos begins

**Example:**
```markdown
TITLE: "THE HIDDEN BOYFRIEND"

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

MARY (20s, conservative) and BOB (20s, disreputable)
making out on couch.

Door KEY in lock. Mary's PARENTS home early.

MARY
(panic)
Hide!

BOB
Where?

MARY
Everywhere! Just hide!

Bob hides behind couch. Parents enter.

MOM
Mary! We're home early!

MARY
(breathless)
I can see that!

MOM
Why are you breathless?

MARY
Exercise! I was... exercising.

MOM
Fully dressed? In heels?

MARY
It's... a new fitness trend. Very European.

```

#### Escalation (2-3 minutes)
- **More people enter:** Each new person complicates situation
- **More hiding places:** Hidden person must move
- **Close calls:** Almost discovered multiple times
- **Physical comedy:** Slapstick, collisions, near-misses

**Beat Structure:**
1. Parents settle in. Bob trapped behind couch.
2. Mailman arrives. Needs signature. Parents distracted. Bob crawls.
3. Mary's brother comes home. Bob now hiding in curtains.
4. Brother nearly pulls curtains. Mary tackles brother "playfully."
5. Bob moves to kitchen. Parents decide to make sandwich.

- **Discovery inevitable:** Can't possibly continue

**Example:**
```markdown
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Parents open refrigerator. Bob is posing as
very large broccoli.

MOM
Strange broccoli.

DAD
Very large broccoli.

MARY
It's... organic?

MOM
(reaches for broccoli)
I'll make a salad.

Bob SPEAKS.

BOB
(as broccoli)
Please don't eat me.

Everyone freezes.

DAD
(to Mary)
Your broccoli is talking.

MARY
It's... a trick broccoli?

```

#### Rapid Resolution (30 seconds)
- **Everything revealed:** Truth comes out in flood
- **Acceptance or chaos:** Characters accept absurdity or run
- **Final door slam:** Someone exits, ending scene

**Example:**
```markdown
BOB
(standing up, no longer posing)
Yes. I am the talking broccoli. I am also
Mary's boyfriend. We have been making out on
your couch for three months. I am unemployed.
I enjoy ska music. I am not good at math.

Dad stares. Mom stares.

DAD
Ska music?

BOB
I know.

DAD
(shrugs)
He's honest. I like him.

MOM
(disappointed)
I really wanted a salad.

Bob: "I can make a salad?"

Dad: "You're hired."

Bob and Mary exit. Parents wave goodbye.

Door closes.

Silence.

DAD
We're very relaxed parents.

```

---

## 5. Stand-Up Set Structure

### Example: 5-Minute Stand-Up Set

**Total Length:** 5 minutes

#### Opener (1 minute)
- **Establish persona:** Who are you? What's your voice?
- **Room read:** Acknowledge audience, venue, situation
- **First big laugh:** Establish that you're funny
- **Topic preview:** What themes will you cover?

**Example:**
```markdown
(COMEDIAN enters stage. Adjusts mic. Looks at audience.)

COMEDIAN
How's everyone doing tonight?

(Applause, polite laughs)

COMEDIAN
Good, good. I asked "how's everyone doing" and
you applauded. That's not an answer. That's just
noise with hands.

(Laugh)

COMEDIAN
I'm [NAME], for those of you who don't know me,
and for those who do know me... I'm sorry.

(Bigger laugh)

COMEDIAN
I want to talk to you tonight about relationships.
Specifically, why I'm single. But also, why
you're single. We're going to figure this out
together.

```

#### Bits 1-3 (2-3 minutes)
- **Distinct topics:** Different but connected themes
- **Personal perspective:** Your unique take
- **Audience interaction:** Engage the room
- **Build momentum:** Start smaller, get bigger

**Example Bit 1: Dating Apps**
```markdown
COMEDIAN
Dating apps are great. You know why? Because
they make you realize how terrible you are at
choosing humans.

(Laugh)

COMEDIAN
I was on this app, swiping left, swiping right,
judging people based on one photo and a bio
that says "I love travel." We all love travel!
That's not a personality trait! That's a basic
human desire to not be in your apartment!

(Big laugh)

COMEDIAN
But then I saw this guy. His photo was... him,
but younger. Definitely younger. And his bio
said "I'm 35" but his face said "I've seen some
things."

(Laugh)

COMEDIAN
But I swiped right. Because I'm an idiot.
```

**Example Bit 2: The Date**
```markdown
COMEDIAN
We meet for coffee. Good, safe, public.
He shows up. He does not look like his photo.
He looks like his photo's older, more disappointed
brother.

(Laugh)

COMEDIAN
But I'm committed. I sit down. He sits down.
He looks at me and says... and I quote...
"You look just like your photo."

(Pause)

COMEDIAN
Which is not a compliment. That's just...
confirmation that I exist.

(Laugh)

COMEDIAN
Then he says: "I'm not really looking for a
relationship. I'm just... looking for someone
to do my taxes."

(Audience confusion, then laughter)

COMEDIAN
I said "What?" He said "You look like you're
good with spreadsheets."

(Big laugh)

COMEDIAN
I AM good with spreadsheets. But that's not
what dating is!
```

#### Callbacks and Connections (1 minute)
- **Reference earlier bits:** Tie themes together
- **Create cohesion:** Show this is a unified set
- **Build to bigger laugh:** Use established jokes for bigger payoff

**Example:**
```markdown
COMEDIAN
So I didn't call him. Obviously. But I did
think about it. Because taxes are confusing.

(Laugh)

COMEDIAN
And that's the problem with dating. We're all
just looking for someone who understands our
spreadsheet. And by spreadsheet, I mean trauma.

(Applause, recognition laugh)

COMEDIAN
We want someone who looks at our mess and says
"Yeah, I want to organize that."

(Big laugh)
```

#### Closer (1 minute)
- **Biggest laugh:** Your strongest material
- **Call back to opening:** Reference earlier joke
- **Satisfying conclusion:** Feel complete
- **Strong exit:** Leave on high note

**Example:**
```markdown
COMEDIAN
So I'm still single. Still swiping. Still hoping
to find someone who doesn't look at me and
think "tax professional."

(Laugh)

COMEDIAN
But maybe that's okay. Maybe we're all just
spreadsheets in the end. Waiting for someone to
organize our chaos. Or at least... help us
find the deductions.

(Big laugh)

COMEDIAN
I've been [NAME]. You've been... people who
applauded when I asked how you were.

(Laugh)

COMEDIAN
Good night!

(Applause)

COMEDIAN exits stage.

```

**Total Laugh Count:** 15-20 distinct laughs (goal: every 15 seconds)

---

## 6. Comedy-Drama Structure (Dramedy)

### Example: Episode Balance

**Balance:** 50% comedy, 50% drama

**Example Scene:**
```markdown
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Character visiting dying parent. Sad moment.

CHARACTER
(to parent)
I love you. I don't say it enough. I should
say it more.

Parent: "I know. You say it with your taxes."

(Pause)

CHARACTER
(laughing through tears)
That doesn't make sense.

PARENT
I'm dying, not a comedian. Cut me some slack.

(Pause. Character cries. Parent reaches out, pats hand.)

PARENT
Also, you're still doing them wrong. You're
missing deductions.

CHARACTER
(tearful laughter)
Of course. That's what I'll remember. Not
your wisdom. Your deductions.

PARENT
(serious)
It's all wisdom. Even the deductions.

Character fully cries now. Parent holds them.
It's sad. It's also funny. It's life.

```

## Subgenre Variations Quick Reference

| Subgenre | Structure Focus | Key Difference |
|----------||----------------|
| **Sitcom** | 3-act, A/B/C stories | Recurring locations, running gags |
| **Rom-Com** | Romance beats + comedy | HEA required, romance drives plot |
| **Satire** | Target + critique | Message primary, comedy supports |
| **Parody** | Source material structure | Mirror specific work/genre |
| **Farce** | Escalation + doorslam | Physical, rapid, chaotic |
| **Dark Comedy** | Taboo + truth | Subject matter dark, execution funny |
| **Sketch** | Premise → heighten → punchline | Short, self-contained |
| **Stand-Up** | Opener → bits → callback + closer | Solo, direct to audience |
| **Dramedy** | Drama + comedy balance | Both elements essential |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **All comedy follows structure** - Even improv has frameworks
2. **Setup + Punchline applies to everything** - Jokes, scenes, stories
3. **Escalation is essential** - Comedy grows, doesn't repeat
4. **Callbacks pay off** - Earlier references create satisfaction
5. **Character drives comedy** - Funny situations + funny characters = great comedy
6. **Format matters** - Different structures for different media
7. **Subgenre has conventions** - Honor them or brilliantly break them
8. **Test everything** - If they don't laugh, it's not comedy

---

**Remember:** These are examples, not rules. Study them, understand them, then make them your own. The best comedy innovates within structure.
