# Comedy Fundamentals and Humor Theory

## What Makes Something Funny?

### The Core Theory of Humor

**The Fundamental Mechanism:**
**Humor = Expectation + Subversion**

When we encounter a setup, our brain recognizes patterns and makes predictions based on those patterns. Laughter occurs when those predictions are subverted in a surprising but acceptable way.

**The Formula:**
1. **Setup** → Establish expectations
2. **Pattern Recognition** → Brain predicts outcome
3. **Punchline** → Subverts expectation
4. **Laughter** → Release of tension

### The Three Theories of Humor

**1. Incongruity Theory** (Most Widely Accepted)
- Humor comes from incongruity between expectation and reality
- We laugh when our expectations are violated in a non-threatening way
- The surprise must be logical within the context established
- Example: "I'm on a seafood diet. I see food and I eat it."

**2. Relief Theory** (Freud)
- Humor is a release of psychic energy
- We laugh to release tension caused by suppressed thoughts or socially unacceptable content
- Explains dark humor, taboo humor, sexual humor
- Laughter as a safety valve for pent-up energy

**3. Superiority Theory** (Hobbes, Descartes)
- We laugh at others' misfortunes to feel superior
- Explains slapstick, pratfalls, schadenfreude
- We laugh "down" at someone else's expense
- Example: Someone slipping on a banana peel

**Modern Understanding:**
Most comedy theorists now believe all three theories explain different TYPES of comedy. Great comedy often uses all three.

## The Anatomy of a Joke

### Basic Structure: Setup + Punchline

**The Setup:**
- Establishes context and assumptions
- Creates expectations in the audience's mind
- Should be concise and clear
- Leads the brain down a specific path

**The Punchline:**
- Subverts the expectation
- Must connect logically to setup
- Creates surprise while making sense
- The "reveal" that triggers laughter

**Example:**
> Setup: "I have an EpiPen. My friend gave it to me as he was dying."
> Expectation: Tragic story about friend's death
> Punchline: "It seemed very important to him that I have it."
> Subversion: The selfishness/misunderstanding in a tragic moment

### Greg Dean's 5 Mechanisms

From Greg Dean's comedy teaching:

1. **1st Story** - The concrete setup that establishes context
2. **Target Assumption** - The specific expectation created
3. **Connector** - The bridge between setup and punchline
4. **Reinterpretation** - The new way of seeing the setup
5. **2nd Story** - The humorous reinterpretation

## Types of Comedy

### By Mechanism

**1. Verbal Comedy**
- Wordplay, puns, double entendre

### By Tone

**1. Light Comedy**
- Gentle, family-friendly

## Comedic Conflict

### What Creates Comedic Conflict

**The Gap:**
- Between expectation and reality
- Between intention and result
- Between appearance and truth
- Between social norms and behavior

**Tension and Release:**
- Setup creates tension
- Punchline provides release
- Laughter as physical release
- Cycle repeats

**The Rule of Three:**
- First instance: establishes pattern
- Second instance: reinforces pattern
- Third instance: breaks pattern (punchline)

## The Comic Perspective

### The Comic Lens

**Seeing the World Differently:**
- Comics notice incongruities others miss
- Question assumptions
- Find absurdity in normal situations
- Take nothing at face value

**The Outsider Perspective:**
- Comic as observer, not participant
- Points out hypocrisies
- Questions social norms
- "Fish out of water"

**The Vulnerable Comic:**
- Self-deprecation
- Personal failures as comedy
- Relatable flaws
- Authenticity creates connection

## Key Comedy Principles

### 1. Truth and Recognition

**Comedy Tells the Truth:**
- Exposes human nature
- Reveals what we're thinking but not saying
- Shows our hypocrisies
- Makes the familiar strange

**Recognition Creates Connection:**
- "That's so true!"
- "I've felt that way!"
- "That's exactly like my life"
- Shared human experience

### 2. Specificity

**Specific Over General:**
- Specific details funnier than general statements
- Concrete examples over abstract concepts
- "My dog" funnier than "a dog"
- Personal experiences more relatable

### 3. Relatability

**Universal Experiences:**
- Dating, work, family, embarrassment
- Social anxiety
- Everyday frustrations
- Common fears and desires

**The "Me Too" Factor:**
- Audience sees themselves
- Shared pain becomes funny
- Community through laughter
- "I'm not alone in feeling this"

### 4. Exaggeration

**Hyperbole:**
- Taking truth to ridiculous extreme
- Making small things huge
- "I've been waiting forever" (5 minutes)
- "I'm so hungry I could eat a horse"

**The Absurd:**
- Taking logic to absurd conclusion
- Monty Python style
- Unexpected consequences
- Surreal situations

### 5. Surprise

**Essential Element:**
- Must be unexpected
- But must make sense in hindsight
- Setup creates expectation
- Punchline violates expectation

**Timing Matters:**
- Pause before punchline
- Let setup land
- Deliver at peak of anticipation

## Comedy vs. Drama

### The Difference

**Drama:**
- Serious treatment of human conflict
- Emotional authenticity
- Character growth through struggle
- Catharsis through emotion

**Comedy:**
- Humorous treatment of human conflict
- Also requires emotional truth
- Character growth through absurdity
- Catharsis through laughter

**The Spectrum:**
- Dramedy (drama + comedy)
- Romantic Comedy (romance + comedy)
- Black Comedy (tragedy + comedy)
- Most stories have both elements
