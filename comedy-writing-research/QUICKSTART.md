# Comedy Writing Quick Start Guide

This guide will get you up and writing comedy quickly, using the comprehensive research in this library.

## Step 1: Understand What Makes Comedy Work (5 minutes)

Read: `comedy-fundamentals/humor-theory.md`

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Humor = Setup + Punchline** - Create expectations, then subvert them
- **All comedy stems from:** Incongruity, relief, or superiority
- **Truth before funny** - Start with something true, then make it funny
- **Character flaws = Comedy opportunities**

**Quick Exercise:**
Take any normal statement and add a subversive punchline:
- Setup: "My girlfriend told me to go out and enjoy myself..."
- Punchline: "...so I went home."

## Step 2: Choose Your Comic Characters (10 minutes)

Read: `characters/comedic-archetypes.md`

**Pick Your Archetypes:**
- Straight man (serious reacts to chaos)
- Comic character (creates chaos through flaws)
- Supporting ensemble (different comic perspectives)

**Character Development:**
- Give them **exaggerated flaws** they don't see
- Give them **blind spots** about themselves
- Make them **relatable** despite absurdity
- Create **conflicting perspectives** between characters

**Quick Exercise:**
Create two characters:
1. One who takes everything too seriously
2. One who doesn't take anything seriously enough
3. Put them in a room together

## Step 3: Pick Your Comedy Structure (10 minutes)

Read: `plot-structure/comedy-structures.md`

**Choose Your Format:**

**For Sitcoms:**
- Cold open → A story → B story → Tag
- Three acts with commercial breaks
- "Three jokes per page" rule

**For Rom-Coms:**
- Meet cute → Forced proximity → Falling in like → Complication → Grand gesture → HEA
- Romance beats + comic set pieces

**For Feature Films:**
- Three-act structure (90-120 minutes)
- Comic set pieces escalate
- Character has growth arc
- Emotional truth + comic exaggeration

**For Sketch/Short-Form:**
- Premise established quickly
- Heighten rapidly
- Punchline/payoff
- Quick exit

**Quick Exercise:**
Map out your structure in 5 bullet points:
1. Opening situation (setup)
2. Comic escalation 1
3. Comic escalation 2
4. Maximum chaos
5. Resolution (character learns nothing, or everything)

## Step 4: Apply Comic Techniques (15 minutes)

Read: `comedy-devices/comic-techniques.md`

**Master These Techniques:**

**Rule of Three:**
- First time: normal
- Second time: reinforced
- Third time: subverted (comic payoff)
- Example: "I have three rules. One, learn the rules. Two, follow the rules. Three, break the rules."

**Incongruity:**
- Put opposite things together
- Expectation vs. reality
- Example: A pacifist barbarian, a neat-freak pig

**Exaggeration:**
- Take truth and amp it up
- Hyperbole for comic effect
- Example: "I'm so hungry I could eat a horse" → "I'm so hungry I could eat the horse AND the stable"

**Misunderstanding:**
- Characters talking past each other
- Different interpretations
- Example: "We need to talk" vs. "We need to talk"

**Callbacks:**
- Reference earlier joke
- Creates cohesion and payoff
- Example: Setup in act 1, payoff in act 3

**Quick Exercise:**
Take Rule of Three and write:
- Normal situation
- Reinforce it
- Subvert it

## Step 5: Master Comic Dialogue and Timing (10 minutes)

Read: `dialogue-timing/dialogue-delivery.md`

**Key Principles:**
- **Subtext over statement** - What they're NOT saying
- **Character voice** - Each sounds different
- **Interruption and overlap** - Characters talk over each other
- **Comic timing** - Pause before/after punchline
- **Reaction shots** - Other characters' reactions are jokes too

**Delivery Styles:**
- **Deadpan** - Serious delivery of absurdity
- **Manic** - High energy, rapid-fire
- **Awkward** - Uncomfortable pauses
- **Sarcastic** - Mocking tone
- **Naive** - Innocent delivery of inappropriate content

**Quick Exercise:**
Write dialogue where:
- Character A makes a reasonable request
- Character B interprets it completely wrong
- Keep Character A serious, Character B confident in their misunderstanding

## Step 6: Choose Your Subgenre (5 minutes)

Read: `subgenres/comedy-formats.md`

**Common Subgenres:**
- **Sitcom** - Character-driven, recurring situations
- **Rom-Com** - Romance + comedy, HEA required
- **Satire** - Social commentary through humor
- **Parody** - Mocking specific work/genre
- **Farce** - Exaggerated, chaotic, physical
- **Dark Comedy** - Taboo subjects, inappropriate humor
- **Sketch** - Premise-based, quick payoff
- **Stand-Up** - Solo performer, direct to audience

**Pick what matches:**
- Your voice/perspective
- Your strengths
- Your interests
- Market opportunities

## Common Comedy Problems (Quick Fixes)

### "Not Funny Enough"
**Check:**
- Is there truth at the core? (All comedy starts with truth)
- Are characters relatable? (We laugh at what we recognize)
- Is there exaggeration? (Truth × 10 = comedy)
- Is there subversion? (Setup expectations, break them)
- Is timing right? (Pause = punch)

**Solutions:**
- Heighten the absurdity
- Cut setup, punchline harder
- Add reaction shots
- Improve timing
- Find deeper truth

### "Jokes Falling Flat"
**Check:**
- Is setup too long? (Cut it)
- Is punchline predictable? (Subvert harder)
- Is word choice weak? (Sharper words)
- Is timing off? (Adjust pauses)

**Solutions:**
- Tighten setup
- Multiple possible punchlines → pick best
- Test with audience
- Rewrite until it works

### "Characters Feel Flat"
**Check:**
- Do they have exaggerated flaws? (Make bigger)
- Do they have blind spots? (Add what they can't see)
- Are they relatable? (Ground in truth)
- Do they have distinct voices? (Different speech patterns)

**Solutions:**
- Give them comic personality disorder
- Make them too much of one thing
- Give them contradictions
- Add running gags

### "Structure Problems"
**Check:**
- Are jokes frequent enough? (3 per page for sitcoms)
- Is there escalation? (Each situation bigger than last)
- Is there variety? (Different joke types)
- Is there pacing? (Build and release tension)

**Solutions:**
- Map set pieces
- Add comic complications
- Vary joke types
- Control escalation

### "Timing Issues"
**Check:**
- Pauses before punchlines? (Let setup land)
- Pauses after punchlines? (Let laughter happen)
- Rhythm and flow? (Comedy has musicality)
- Pacing consistent? (Match tone)

**Solutions:**
- Mark beats and pauses
- Read aloud for rhythm
- Cut dead space
- Adjust delivery

## Next Steps

1. **Read full research files** for comprehensive understanding
2. **Study examples** in `examples/structure-examples.md`

4. **Write regularly** - comedy is a muscle
5. **Test material** - perform or share to get feedback
6. **Revise systematically** using the checklist

## Remember

**Comedy is:**
- **Truth + Exaggeration** - Find something true, make it bigger
- **Setup + Punchline** - Create expectation, subvert it
- **Recognition + Surprise** - Make them say "I've been there" AND "I never saw that coming"
- **Structure + Freedom** - Learn the rules, then break them brilliantly

**Comedy is not:**
- Just jokes - It needs character and story
- Just shock value - It needs truth
- Just being silly - It needs intelligence
- Just for laughs - It needs to say something

**The Golden Rule:**
**If it's not funny, it's not comedy.** Test everything. If they don't laugh, fix it or cut it.

**Now go write something funny!**
