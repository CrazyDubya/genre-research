## Quick Diagnostic Tests

### The "Not Funny" Test

1. Is there a joke? (Clear setup + punchline)
2. Is there truth? (Recognizable foundation)
3. Is there surprise? (Unexpected twist)
4. Is timing right? (Pause before/after)
5. Is it appropriate? (Right audience, right context)

### The "Confusing" Test
If someone doesn't get it:
1. Is premise clear? (Can you state it in one sentence?)
2. Is setup too long? (Cut to punchline)
3. Is reference obscure? (Clarify or cut)
4. Is logic sound? (Does it make sense on its own terms?)
5. Is context missing? (Provide necessary setup)

### The "Offensive" Test
If someone is offended:
1. Is offense justified? (Dark comedy needs purpose)
2. Is target appropriate? (Punching up vs. down)
3. Is truth present? (Offense should reveal something)
4. Is it funny despite? (Humor must exist beyond shock)
5. Is it worth it? (What's gained vs. what's lost?)

### The "Too Long" Test
If someone says "it drags":
1. Are there enough jokes? (Increase frequency)
2. Is setup too long? (Cut to punchline faster)
3. Are scenes too long? (Shorter scenes, more cuts)
4. Is subplots boring? (Cut or connect to main plot)

## Common Revision Pitfalls

### Don't:
- Over-explain jokes (trust the audience)
- Save jokes for later (use them now or cut them)
- Defend unfunny material (if they don't laugh, it doesn't work)
- Ignore feedback (but don't implement blindly)
- Revise in isolation (test with audiences)

### Do:
- Cut ruthlessly (if it's not funny, cut it)
- Test repeatedly (comedy needs audience reaction)
- Trust your instincts (but verify with testing)
- Know when to stop (you can revise forever)
- Move on to next thing (you learn more by writing new material)
