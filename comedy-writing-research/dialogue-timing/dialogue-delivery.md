# Comedy Dialogue, Timing and Delivery

## Writing Comedic Dialogue

### Principles of Funny Dialogue

**1. Subtext Over Statement**
- What's not said is as important as what is
- Characters avoid truth
- Indirectness creates tension
- Punchline reveals subtext

**2. Character Voice**
- Each character sounds distinct
- Their comedy comes from perspective
- Consistent worldview
- Unique way of speaking

**3. Misunderstanding**
- Characters talk past each other
- Different interpretations
- Wrong conclusions reached
- Comedy from confusion

**4. Interruption and Overlap**
- Characters cut each other off
- Talking over each other
- Creates energy and chaos
- Naturalistic but heightened

**5. The Call Back**
- References earlier jokes
- Creates continuity
- Bigger laugh through familiarity
- Rewards attention

### Dialogue Patterns

**The Rule of Three in Dialogue:**
- Character A makes statement
- Character B responds
- Character C adds twist
- Or A repeats with variation

**The Interrupt:**
- Setup: Character starts serious speech
- Interruption: Undermines seriousness
- Result: Comedy from contrast

**The Misunderstanding:**
- Character A: "I'm giving it all up."
- Character B: "You're giving up everything? Your house, your car?"
- Character A: "No, just giving up."

## Timing and Rhythm

### The Beat

**What Is a Beat:**
- Pause in dialogue or action
- Moment for reaction
- Time for laugh to land
- Building anticipation

**Types of Beats:**
- **Short Beat:** Quick pause, emphasis
- **Long Beat:** Awkward silence
- **Reaction Beat:** Character processes
- **Laugh Beat:** Let audience laugh

### Comic Timing

**The Pause Before Punchline:**
- Build anticipation
- Hold for it...
- Deliver at peak moment
- Release tension with laugh

**The Pause After Punchline:**
- Let laugh happen
- Don't step on it
- Wait for silence
- Continue when ready

**Pacing Variation:**
- Fast sections: High energy, chaos
- Slow sections: Build tension, awkwardness
- Variation creates rhythm
- Musicality of comedy

### Delivery Styles

**Deadpan (Stone Face):**
- No emotion shown
- Contrast between words and delivery
- Buster Keaton, Steven Wright
- "I once had a fear of speed..."

**Manic Energy:**
- Fast delivery
- High energy
- Over-the-top
- Robin Williams, Jim Carrey

**Awkward Hesitation:**

## Verbal Comedy Techniques

### Wordplay and Puns

**Double Meanings:**
- "Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana."
- Words with multiple interpretations
- Context reveals second meaning
- Cleverness appreciated

**Sound-Alikes:**
- "I see," said the blind man to his deaf dog
- Words that sound similar
- Confusion creates humor
- "I'm on a seafood diet..."

### Malapropisms

**Confused Words:**
- Using wrong word (similar sound)
- "Illiterate? What do you read?" (instead of literature)
- Archie Bunker style
- Character flaw revealed

### Double Entendre

**Two Meanings:**
- One innocent
- One risqué or hidden
- Both interpretations work
- Audience gets both

**Example:**
"If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?"

## Response Patterns

### The Snappy Comeback

**Structure:**
- Insult or setup delivered
- Pause (the beat)
- Comeback response
- Bigger laugh

**Techniques:**
- Turn insult back
- Agree with insult to defuse
- Take literally
- Miss point intentionally

**Example:**
A: "You're fat."
B: "I may be fat, but you're ugly, and I can diet."

### The Delayed Reaction

**Comedic Pause:**
- Statement made
- Pause for processing
- Delayed reaction
- "Wait, what?"

**Why It Works:**
- Timing surprise
- Character slow on uptake
- Builds anticipation
- Reaction is punchline

## Silence as Comedy

### The Awkward Pause

**Cringe Comedy:**
- Character says something awkward
- Silence follows
- Others react uncomfortably
- Audience cringes too

**The Office Style:**

- Awkward silence
- No laugh track
- Real discomfort

### Pregnant Pause

**Build Anticipation:**

- Stops mid-sentence
- Pause extends
- Everyone waits
- Punchline breaks tension

- Conversations go in circles
- Selfish priorities
- Comic conflicts emerge
