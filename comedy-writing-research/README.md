## Core Principles Emphasized

### The Comedy Formula

**Humor = Setup + Punchline**
- Create expectations
- Subvert those expectations
- Truth at the foundation
- Surprise in the execution

**Character = Flaws + Blind Spots**
- Exaggerated flaws create situations
- Blind spots create irony
- Characters don't see themselves clearly
- Audience knows more than characters
- Relatable despite absurdity

**Comedy = Truth + Exaggeration**
- Start with recognizable truth
- Exaggerate for comic effect
- "It's funny because it's true"
- Recognition creates connection
- Exaggeration creates humor

**Timing = Rhythm + Pause**
- Comedy has musicality
- Pause before punchline (build tension)
- Pause after punchline (let laughter happen)
- Know when to deliver
- Know when to wait

### The Reader/Viewer Contract

**Audience Expectations:**
- Laugh frequently (joke density)
- Be surprised (subvert expectations)
- Recognize truth (relatable content)
- Be entertained (not preached at)
- Satisfying payoff (callbacks, structure)

**Comedy Requirements:**
- If it's not funny, it's not comedy
- Test everything with audience
- Cut what doesn't work
- Revise until it lands
- Timing is everything

### Character Depth

**Comic Characters Must:**
- Have exaggerated flaws (bigger is funnier)
- Have blind spots (what they can't see)
- Be relatable (recognizable truths)
- Have distinct voices (unique perspectives)
- Create comedy through interactions
- Stay consistent (or change deliberately)

**Comic Dynamics Must:**
- Create conflict (opposing perspectives)
- Generate situations (flaws collide)
- Provide contrast (straight man vs. comic)
- Escalate naturally (grows from character)
- Pay off earnedly (callbacks, running gags)

### Narrative Purpose

**Every Element Must:**
- Generate laughs (primary purpose)
- Develop character (secondary purpose)
- Serve structure (pacing, escalation)
- Explore themes (optional, not required)
- Satisfy audience (entertainment first)

**Comedy is NOT:**
- Just jokes (needs character and story)
- Just shock value (needs truth)
- Just being silly (needs intelligence)
- Just message (needs to be funny first)

### Audience Engagement

**Intellectual Challenge:**
- Setup creates puzzle
- Punchline provides solution
- Surprise creates delight
- Recognition creates connection

**Emotional Journey:**
- Care about characters (even awful ones)
- Invest in outcome (want to see resolution)
- Feel the tension (timing, anticipation)
- Experience the release (laughter)
- Satisfaction at payoff (callbacks, structure)

## Common Problems Addressed

### "Not Funny Enough"
- **Problem:** Jokes aren't landing, weak response
- **Solutions:** Heighten exaggeration, cut setup words, sharpen punchlines, improve timing
- **Reference:** Comedy devices, dialogue delivery, timing sections

### "Jokes Falling Flat"
- **Problem:** Setup works, punchline doesn't deliver
- **Solutions:** Test alternative punchlines, cut setup words, improve word choice, adjust timing
- **Reference:** Joke structure, dialogue efficiency sections

### "Characters Feel Flat"
- **Problem:** Characters aren't funny or memorable
- **Solutions:** Exaggerate flaws more, add blind spots, create distinct voices, develop comic dynamics
- **Reference:** Character archetypes, character development sections

### "Structure Drags"
- **Problem:** Pacing issues, boring sections
- **Solutions:** Increase joke density, add comic complications, escalate situations, cut dead scenes
- **Reference:** Plot structure, pacing, escalation sections

### "Timing Off"
- **Problem:** Jokes land poorly, rhythm feels wrong
- **Solutions:** Mark beats and pauses, read aloud for rhythm, cut dead space, adjust delivery
- **Reference:** Dialogue delivery, timing sections

### "Confusing Premise"
- **Problem:** Audience doesn't "get it"
- **Solutions:** Clarify setup, state comic premise clearly, establish expectations before subverting
- **Reference:** Comedy fundamentals, structure sections

### "Offensive Without Purpose"
- **Problem:** Dark comedy feels gratuitous
- **Solutions:** Ensure truth beneath offense, justify taboo content, add purpose beyond shock
- **Reference:** Dark comedy, subgenre sections

- Include your own templates and worksheets
- Document successful jokes/bits and analyze why they worked
- Add audience testing results
- Include timing and delivery notes

## Best Practices

### Planning
- Know your comic premise before writing
- Map major jokes and set pieces
- Plan escalation (situations get bigger)
- Design running gags with payoffs
- Establish character voices clearly

### Writing
- Plant jokes early and often
- Develop characters through flaws
- Vary joke types for variety
- Build comic momentum
- Control information release

### Testing
- Test everything with audience
- Read aloud for timing
- Perform material if possible
- Record and review performances
- Note what works and what doesn't

### Revision
- Use revision checklist systematically
- Cut unfunny jokes ruthlessly
- Improve timing based on testing
- Strengthen weak punches
- Trust audience reaction over your intention

## Reminders

### What Comedy Is
- Entertainment first, message second (or third)
- Truth exaggerated for effect
- Setup and subversion of expectations
- Recognition and surprise simultaneously
- Subjective and audience-dependent

### What Comedy Isn't
- Just jokes (needs character and story)
- Just shock (needs truth and purpose)
- Just being silly (needs intelligence)
- Just message delivery (needs laughs first)
- Universal (what's funny varies by audience)

### The Golden Rule
**If it's not funny, it's not comedy.** Everything else is secondary to the laugh. Test everything. If they don't laugh, fix it or cut it. No exceptions.
