# Style Integrity Guidelines (Originality-First Approach)

## Core Principles

1. **Originality First** - Author's voice and vision take priority
2. **Consistency Within Context** - Style should match genre, format, and story intent
3. **Intentionality** - Every style choice should serve the story
4. **Transparency** - Changes and suggestions should explain their purpose
5. **Author Control** - Tools assist but never override author decisions

## Style Elements to Track

### Voice Characteristics
- Narrative distance (intimate vs. distant)
- Sentence rhythm and syntax patterns
- Vocabulary register and formality
- Emotional tone and attitude
- Character voice distinctiveness

### Consistency Markers
- POV consistency within scenes
- Dialogue tags and speech patterns
- Description depth and style
- Internal monologue tone
- Metaphor and imagery patterns

### Genre-Specific Elements
- Pacing expectations
- Expected narrative conventions
- Audience expectations
- Format-specific requirements
- Subgenre markers

## Originality Assessment

### Questions to Ask
- Is this the author's authentic voice or an imitation?
- Does this choice serve the story or follow a template?
- Is the style consistent with author intent?
- Does it match the target genre without sacrificing uniqueness?
- Are there clichés that could be freshened?

### Red Flags
- Overuse of common phrase patterns
- Genre-standard descriptions (stormy nights, sparkling eyes)
- Dialogue that sounds like screenplay format
- Over-writing in descriptions
- Inconsistent voice across chapters

## Guidance Tools

### Style Checker Framework
1. **Detect:** Identify style elements (voice, consistency, patterns)
2. **Compare:** Check against author's established patterns
3. **Suggest:** Offer alternatives that preserve author's voice
4. **Preserve:** Never change style automatically - always suggest

### Voice Integrity Check
- Pull sample passages from different chapters
- Identify core voice characteristics
- Flag significant deviations
- Suggest consistency improvements

### Originality Validation
- Check for overused phrases in target genre
- Identify clichés specific to story type
- Suggest original alternatives
- Preserve author's intentional choices

## Best Practices

### For Tool Builders
- Provide suggestions, not requirements
- Explain why a change is suggested
- Show how change affects voice
- Offer multiple options
- Let author choose final version

### For Authors
- Define your voice early (or discover it through writing)
- Use consistency checks to validate voice
- Apply style corrections selectively
- Mark intentional deviations (archaic speech, character voice shift)
- Trust your unique voice

### For Editors
- Distinguish between style and substance
- Preserve author voice while improving clarity
- Suggest rather than change
- Document reasoning for changes
- Respect originality choices

## Approval Gates

### Pre-Revision Gate
- Author confirms current voice baseline
- Editor understands author's style intent
- Both agree on consistency targets

### Post-Revision Gate
- Changes preserve author's core voice
- Consistency improvements serve the story
- Originality is maintained or enhanced
- Both parties approve modifications

### Export Gate
- Final voice check
- Consistency validation
- Originality confirmation
- Style locked for publication
