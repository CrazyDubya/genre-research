## What Is Horror?

**Core Elements:**
- **Fear:** The core emotion
- **Threat:** Something that endangers characters
- **Vulnerability:** Characters cannot easily defeat threat
- **Empathy:** Reader must care about characters to feel fear

**The Horror Equation:**

**FEAR = VULNERABILITY × THREAT × EMPATHY**

## Step 2: Establish Your Threat

### Threat Profile

**What is the threat?**
- Supernatural entity (ghost, demon, curse)
- Human killer
- Creature/monster
- Virus/infection
- Psychological (madness, paranoia)

**Threat's Three Rules:**
1. [First rule of how threat operates]
2. [Second rule]
3. [Third rule]

**Example (Jaws):**
1. Shark hunts in shallow water (beaches)
2. Shark is relentless (keeps coming)
3. Shark can be killed (but at great cost)

**Why Rules Matter:**
- Create limitations (story opportunities)
- Build reader trust (consistency)
- Generate conflicts (can't just escape)

---

## Step 3: Create Your Character

### Horror Hero Archetypes

**The Final Girl/Guy:**
- Sole survivor who confronts threat
- Pure/innocent (or relatable/flawed)
- Resourceful and observant

**The Skeptic:**
- Doesn't believe in threat initially
- Rational, scientific
- Becomes believer (usually too late)

**The Protector:**
- Driven to protect others
- Parent, sibling, guardian
- Self-sacrificing

**The Survivor:**
- Ordinary person forced to survive
- Grows into hero through horror
- Reader surrogate

**The Expert:**
- Knows about threat
- Guides protagonist
- Often damaged by past encounter

### Character Questions

1. **How are they vulnerable?** (Physical, psychological, situational)
2. **What do they fear?** (Loss, death, madness, guilt)
3. **What do they want?** (External goal)
4. **What do they really need?** (Internal need)
5. **How do they change?** (Character arc)

**Remember:** Character is MORE important than threat. If we don't care, we don't feel fear.

## Step 4: Structure Your Story

### The Universal Horror Structure

**Act One: Setup (25%)**
- Normal world (before horror)
- Inciting incident (horror begins)
- First scare (threat demonstrated)
- Character awareness (or denial)
- Commitment (must confront/escape)

**Act Two: Confrontation (50%)**
- Early encounters (learn threat's rules)
- Escalation (threat becomes more dangerous)
- Midpoint shift (major revelation)
- Setbacks (failures, losses)
- All is lost (character's lowest point)
- Breakthrough (finds solution)

**Act Three: Resolution (25%)**
- Final confrontation
- Climax (maximum terror/horror)
- Resolution
- Character changed forever

### Scare Pacing Pattern

**Tension → Release → Tension → Release**

**Example:**
1. Build tension (character walks down dark hallway)
2. Release with false alarm (cat jumps out)
3. Build tension again (character continues)
4. Release with real scare (monster attacks)

**Key: Alternate dread and terror. Constant scares desensitize reader.**

## Step 5: Design Your Scares

### Types of Scares

**Dread Scare (Anticipation):**
- Something's coming (don't know what or when)
- Atmosphere of wrongness
- Reader's imagination fills gaps
- Best for: Opening, slow build

**Terror Scare (Immediate Danger):**
- In-the-moment fear
- Character's life at stake RIGHT NOW
- Fight-or-flight response
- Best for: Climax, action scenes

**Jump Scare (Startle):**
- Sudden shock + loud noise
- Immediate reaction (flinch)
- Overuse desensitizes
- Best for: Varied with other scare types

**Gross-Out Scare (Disgust):**
- Body horror, gore, infection
- Visceral revulsion
- Use sparingly (for impact)
- Best for: Body horror subgenre

**Psychological Scare (Mind Games):**
- Blurred reality (is this real?)
- Madness, paranoia
- Lasting unease
- Best for: Psychological horror

### Scare Design Formula

**Effective Scare = Setup × Tension × Payoff**

**Setup:** Establish vulnerability (character endangered)
**Tension:** Build anticipation (something's coming)
**Payoff:** Release (scare happens)

**Without all three:**
- No setup = no tension (no dread)
- No tension = no anticipation (just shock)
- No payoff = disappointment (no release)

## Essential Horror Principles

### Principle 1: Fear Requires Vulnerability

If character can easily defeat threat, it's action, not horror.

**Apply:**
- Make threat stronger than character
- Trap character (no easy escape)
- Limit resources (weapons, help, information)

### Principle 2: Less Is More (At First)

Unknown is scarier than known (until reveal).

**Apply:**
- Withhold threat initially
- Show aftermath, not attack
- Use sound/shadows
- Reader's imagination fills gaps

### Principle 3: Empathy Equals Fear

If reader doesn't care about character, they won't feel fear.

**Apply:**
- Develop character before threat
- Make character relatable (flawed but human)
- Create investment in survival

### Principle 4: Atmosphere Over Gore

Suggestion > Graphic (usually).

**Apply:**
- Build dread through atmosphere
- Use sensory details
- Imply violence (not always show)
- Reserve gore for impact

### Principle 5: Play Fair

Follow established rules, pay off setups.

**Apply:**
- Establish threat's nature/rules
- Don't change rules mid-story
- Pay off foreshadowing
- Earn scares through buildup

### Principle 6: Confront Fear, Don't Exploit

Horror should reveal something about humanity.

**Apply:**
- Use threat to explore theme
- Face real fears (death, loss, isolation)
- Create meaning, not just shocks
- Leave lasting impact

## Common Horror Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Character Too Stupid to Live

**Problem:** Character makes decisions that serve plot but make no sense.

**Fix:**
- Decisions make sense in context (fear explains poor judgment)
- Character has limited information (doesn't know what reader knows)
- No better options (trapped, desperate)

### Mistake 2: Not Scary

**Problem:** Reader feels no fear.

**Fix:**
- Build vulnerability (character endangered)
- Create empathy (care about character)
- Increase isolation (no help can arrive)
- Use atmosphere (mood, setting, tension)

### Mistake 3: Too Many Jump Scares

**Problem:** Constant startles, reader becomes desensitized.

**Fix:**
- Vary scare types (dread, terror, psychological)
- Build tension between scares
- Use jump scares for payoff (not constant)

### Mistake 4: Bland Protagonist

**Problem:** Character has no personality.

**Fix:**
- Establish character before threat
- Give flaws and strengths (real human)
- Unique voice/perspective
- Personal stakes (what matters to them?)

### Mistake 5: All Scares Same

**Problem:** Every scare feels identical.

**Fix:**
- Vary scare types (dread, terror, gross-out, psychological)
- Different locations (not all same place)
- Escalation (each scare worse than last)

## The Golden Rule of Horror

**CHARACTER IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MONSTER.**

All the vampires, zombies, ghosts, and killers in existence don't matter if we don't care about the people they're threatening.

**FEAR = VULNERABILITY × THREAT × EMPATHY**

Without empathy, there is no fear.

**The Best Horror Stories Focus On:**
- Character transformation through horror
- Emotional truth in terrifying situations
- Meaning found in facing fear
- Vulnerability that creates genuine stakes
- Growth earned through survival

The monsters are fascinating, but the people are what make us scream.
