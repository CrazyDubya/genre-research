## What Is Horror?

**Definition:** Stories designed to elicit fear, dread, disgust, or terror.

**Core Purpose:** To explore and confront our fears in a safe environment.

**The Horror Contract:**
Audience agrees to feel uncomfortable/frightened in exchange for:
- **Catharsis:** Confronting fears safely
- **Thrills:** Adrenaline rush
- **Meaning:** Insight into human nature
- **Entertainment:** Enjoying being scared

**Three Levels of Fear:**

**1. Dread (Anticipatory Fear)**
- Something bad is going to happen
- Anxiety, unease, knot in stomach
- Examples: Opening scene of The Shining, any dark hallway scene

**2. Terror (Immediate Fear)**
- In-the-moment danger
- Fight-or-flight response
- Examples: Raptor scene in Jurassic Park, "Here's Johnny!" scene

**3. Horror (Revulsion/Awe)**
- Fear mixed with disgust or existential dread
- The unnatural, the abject
- Examples: Chestburster scene in Alien, cosmic revelations in Lovecraft

**The Best Horror Stories Use All Three:**
- Build dread (anticipation)
- Deliver terror (immediate danger)
- Reveal horror (disturbing truth)

<a name="core-principles"></a>

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Fear Requires Vulnerability

If character can easily defeat threat, it's action, not horror.

**Apply:**
- Make threat stronger than character
- Trap character (no easy escape)
- Limit resources (weapons, help, information)

### Principle 2: Less Is More (At First)

Unknown is scarier than known (until reveal).

**Apply:**
- Withhold monster initially
- Show aftermath, not attack
- Use sound/shadows
- Reader's imagination fills gaps

### Principle 3: Empathy Equals Fear

If reader doesn't care about character, they won't feel fear.

**Apply:**
- Develop character before threat
- Make character relatable (flawed but human)
- Create investment in survival

### Principle 4: Atmosphere Over Gore

Suggestion > Graphic (usually).

**Apply:**
- Build dread through atmosphere
- Use sensory details
- Imply violence (not always show)
- Reserve gore for impact

### Principle 5: Play Fair

Follow established rules, pay off setups.

**Apply:**
- Establish threat's nature/rules
- Don't change rules mid-story
- Pay off foreshadowing
- Earn scares through buildup

### Principle 6: Confront Fear, Don't Exploit

Horror should reveal something about humanity.

**Apply:**
- Use threat to explore theme
- Face real fears (death, loss, isolation)
- Create meaning, not just shocks
- Leave lasting impact

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem: Not Scary

**Symptom:** Reader feels no fear.

**Solutions:**
- Build vulnerability (character not endangered enough)
- Create empathy (don't care about character)
- Increase isolation (character can get help too easily)
- Use atmosphere (jumping to action)

### Problem: Too Many Jump Scares

**Symptom:** Constant startles, reader becomes desensitized.

**Solutions:**
- Vary scare types (dread, terror, psychological)
- Build tension between scares
- Use jump scares for payoff (not constant)

### Problem: Character Stupidity

**Symptom:** "Why would they do that?!"

**Solutions:**
- Decisions make sense in context (fear explains poor judgment)
- Character has limited information (doesn't know what reader knows)
- No better options (trapped, desperate)

### Problem: Bland Protagonist

**Symptom:** Character has no personality.

**Solutions:**
- Establish character before threat
- Give flaws and strengths (real human)
- Unique voice/perspective
- Personal stakes (what matters to them?)

### Problem: Static Character

**Symptom:** Character doesn't change through horror experience.

**Solutions:**
- Horror should transform (trauma changes people)
- Loss of innocence (world is darker)
- Discovery of strength (didn't know they had it in them)

## Key Concepts

### Fear Equation

**FEAR = VULNERABILITY × THREAT × EMPATHY**

**Vulnerability:**
- Physical (child, injured, trapped)
- Psychological (grieving, traumatized)

## FAQ

### Q: What's the difference between horror and thriller?

**A:**
- **Horror:** Elicits fear, dread, disgust (supernatural or heightened threats)
- **Thriller:** Elicits suspense, tension (realistic threats, crime, espionage)

**Overlap:** Many stories blend both (horror-thriller)

### Q: Do I need graphic violence/gore?

**A:** No. Some of the best horror is:
- Suggested (reader's imagination is scarier)
- Atmospheric (dread, not graphic)
- Psychological (messes with mind, not body)

**Gore works when:**
- Used sparingly (for impact)
- Serves story/character
- Has purpose (what does gore reveal?)

### Q: How do I make my story scary?

**A:**
1. **Create vulnerability** (character cannot easily defeat threat)
2. **Build empathy** (reader cares about character)
3. **Use atmosphere** (mood, setting, sensory details)
4. **Vary scares** (dread, terror, psychological, not just jump scares)
5. **Escalate** (each scare tops previous)

**Remember: FEAR = VULNERABILITY × THREAT × EMPATHY**

### Q: Can horror be funny?

**A:** Yes! Horror-comedy is a popular blend.
- Examples: Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil
- Balance: Scary AND funny (not one at expense of other)
- Humor often comes from characters (how they respond to horror)

### Q: How do I avoid clichés?

**A:**
1. **Know the tropes** (read widely in your subgenre)
2. **Subvert them** (use familiar trope, then twist it)
3. **Character depth** (clichés often come from flat characters)
4. **Innovation within convention** (follow structure, make it fresh)

**Example:** Scream (characters know horror rules, deconstructs them)

### Q: What's the biggest mistake new horror writers make?

**A:** **Focusing on the monster more than the people.**

**Remember:** Character is more important than threat. If we don't care about the people, we won't feel fear when they're endangered.
