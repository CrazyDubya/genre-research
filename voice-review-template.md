# Voice Review & Revision Template

Use this template to lock a narrative voice, audit rhythm, propose alternates without drift, and track edits line-by-line.

## 1) Voice Parameters (define the lock)

Fill in each field to capture the voice you must preserve.

- **POV:** (1st/3rd/omniscient; limited vs. deep)  
  - **Distance:** (close/medium/far)  
  - **Access:** (interior monologue, sensory emphasis, knowledge limits)
- **Tone:** (e.g., dry, lyrical, sardonic, tender, clinical)  
  - **Emotional range:** (muted → volatile)  
  - **Register:** (formal/neutral/colloquial/slang)
- **Diction:** (word length, specificity, favorite domains)  
  - **Preferred verbs:** (active, kinetic, understated)  
  - **Taboo words/phrases:** (avoid list)
- **Sentence length mix:**  
  - **Short:** % (≤8 words)  
  - **Medium:** % (9–18 words)  
  - **Long:** % (19+ words)  
  - **Average target:** ____ words  
  - **Typical cadence:** (e.g., short-short-long)
- **Signature moves:** (parallelism, fragments, rhetorical questions, lists, ellipses)
- **Narrator posture:** (judgmental/observant/intimate/detached; level of certainty)

## 2) Rhythm Analysis

Analyze a representative passage (200–500 words). Record measurements and highlight cadence.

- **Sentence length variance:**  
  - Min/Max: ____ / ____  
  - Mean/Median: ____ / ____  
  - Standard deviation (rough): ____  
- **Cadence highlights:**  
  - Where does the pacing spike? Why?  
  - Where does it deliberately slow? Why?  
  - Note any “hinge” sentences that pivot emotion or scene.
- **Pattern notes:**  
  - Repeated sentence openings?  
  - Overused punctuation?  
  - Paragraph density (tight/airy)?

## 3) Alternative Phrasings (voice lock)

Generate alternates that keep the voice parameters unchanged. Label which parameter is being protected.

**Source line:**
> “________________________________________”

**Alternates (keep POV/tone/diction/cadence):**
1. ________________________________ (locks: POV + tone)  
2. ________________________________ (locks: diction + cadence)  
3. ________________________________ (locks: signature move)

**Voice lock check:**
- [ ] POV unchanged  
- [ ] Tone consistent  
- [ ] Diction within range  
- [ ] Sentence length mix preserved

## 4) Line-by-Line Suggestions (tracked changes)

Provide edits with visible del/ins. Use Markdown for clarity.

**Original**
> The street was quiet. I felt like I was waiting for something to break.

**Tracked changes**
> The street was ~~quiet~~ <ins>empty</ins>. I felt like I was waiting for something to <ins>snap</ins>.

**Notes:** Explain why the change is voice-consistent.

## 5) Consistency Checks Across Chapters (voice drift)

Run this checklist between chapters or drafts.

- **POV discipline:** Any head-hops or knowledge leaks?
- **Tone drift:** Does humor/bleakness intensity shift without cause?
- **Diction creep:** New slang, jargon, or verbosity?
- **Cadence shift:** Suddenly uniform or overly choppy?
- **Signature moves:** Missing or overused?
- **Narrator posture:** Has certainty/attitude shifted?

**Drift log (per chapter):**

| Chapter | Drift observed | Evidence (line/phrase) | Fix strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |

---

**Tip:** Keep a 2–3 paragraph “voice sample” from the best chapter. Re-read before each new chapter and compare cadence + diction.
