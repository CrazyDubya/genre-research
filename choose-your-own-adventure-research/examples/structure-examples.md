## Applying These Techniques

### For Your CYOA

**If You're Writing Traditional CYOA:**

**Branching Structure:**
- Consider hub-based (exploration-friendly)
- Or linear with branches (narrative-focused)
- Or true branching (max player agency)
- Choose structure that serves your story

**Choice Design:**
- Make choices meaningful
- Hint at consequences (fairness)
- Avoid false choices
- Every choice should lead to distinct content

**Replay Value:**
- Multiple endings
- Hidden content
- Different branches unique
- Incentivize replay

**Pacing:**
- Hook immediately
- Build tension
- Satisfying endings
- Don't pad (every section should matter)
