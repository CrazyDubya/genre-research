**Repetitive Content:**
- [ ] Same text across branches
- Fix: Vary content, make each branch unique

**Inconsistent World:**
- [ ] World details contradict between branches
- Fix: Establish consistent base, note intentional differences

**Unclear Goals:**

## Testing Questions

**Ask Test Readers:**

---

## Priority Revisions

**If Time Is Limited, Prioritize:**

1. **Critical:** Fix broken paths, ensure all choices work
2. **High:** Fix unfair deaths, improve choice clarity
3. **Medium:** Improve prose, enhance descriptions
4. **Low:** Add polish, expand branches, enhance endings

## Readability, Vocabulary, and Style Checks
