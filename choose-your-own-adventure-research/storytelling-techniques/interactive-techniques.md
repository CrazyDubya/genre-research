## Understanding Interactive Storytelling

### The Foundation: Reader-Centered Narrative

In Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) stories, the traditional relationship between narrator and reader is fundamentally altered. The narrator creates a framework within which the reader actively participates in story creation through choices. This requires unique storytelling techniques that maintain narrative coherence while allowing for multiple possible directions.

**Core Principles:**
- **Branching Coherence:** Each possible story path must be narratively coherent
- **Reader Agency:** Reader's choices must feel meaningful and impactful
- **Consistent Voice:** Narrative voice remains consistent across all paths
- **Thematic Unity:** Story themes remain coherent across all possible paths
- **Character Continuity:** Characters remain consistent across different story paths
- **World Consistency:** Story world remains logical across all choices

### The CYOA Narrative Contract

#### Reader Expectations
- **Meaningful Choices:** Every decision should impact the story in visible ways
- **Fair Challenges:** Story doesn't require supernatural knowledge to succeed
- **Logical Consequences:** Outcomes follow naturally from choices made
- **Complete Paths:** Each path offers a satisfying experience
- **Consistent World:** Story world follows consistent rules regardless of path taken

#### Writer Responsibilities
- **Meaningful Divergence:** Each choice option leads to noticeably different experiences
- **Maintain Consistency:** World and character logic remain stable across paths
- **Provide Fair Information:** Readers have enough information to make informed choices
- **Ensure All Paths Function:** Every narrative path is complete and satisfying
- **Respect Reader Agency:** Choices genuinely affect the story outcome
