## Audience Definition

Create a detailed reader profile:

```markdown
## Target Reader Profile

### Audience Expectations

Document what readers expect:

#### Core Expectations (Must Deliver)
- Genre promises that cannot be broken
- Emotional payoffs required
- Structural conventions expected
- Character types anticipated

#### Enhanced Expectations (Should Deliver)
- Elevated execution of familiar elements
- Fresh take on conventions
- Depth beyond minimum requirements
- Memorable moments

#### Surprise Expectations (Could Deliver)
- Unexpected elements that delight
- Subverted expectations (carefully)
- Cross-genre appeal
- Discussion-worthy elements

## Positioning Strategy

### The Positioning Statement

Create a clear positioning statement:

```markdown
## Positioning Statement

For [target audience] who [key need/desire],
[Project title] is a [genre] that [primary benefit/promise].
Unlike [key competitor/convention],
our story [key differentiator].
```

**Example:**
"For romance readers who love enemies-to-lovers with high stakes, *Rival Hearts* is a romantic suspense that delivers intense chemistry alongside genuine danger. Unlike typical romantic suspense where the mystery overshadows romance, our story maintains equal emotional investment in both the romantic relationship and the suspense plot, with each amplifying the other."

### Differentiation

Identify your unique position:

#### Sameness (Genre Compliance)
What familiar elements ensure genre satisfaction:
- Expected tropes executed well
- Genre conventions honored
- Emotional beats delivered
- Reader expectations met

#### Difference (Unique Value)
What sets this work apart:
- Fresh perspective on familiar genre
- Unique setting or world
- Unexpected character dynamics
- Innovative structural approach
- Cross-genre elements

### The "Same But Different" Balance

Successful positioning balances:
- **Enough sameness** that readers know what they're getting
- **Enough difference** that readers want this specific book

Too much sameness = "Why read this when I've read that?"
Too much difference = "This isn't what I wanted from this genre"

## Commercial Viability Assessment

### Market Fit Evaluation

Score your project on market fit:

| Factor | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Genre clarity | | Is genre immediately clear? |
| Audience alignment | | Does it serve target readers? |
| Trend relevance | | Current or timeless appeal? |
| Comp availability | | Can you find good comps? |
| Differentiation | | Does it stand out appropriately? |
| Emotional promise | | Clear emotional value proposition? |

**Score Interpretation:**
- 25-30: Strong commercial positioning
- 20-24: Good positioning with optimization opportunities
- 15-19: Positioning needs work
- Below 15: Significant positioning concerns

### Risk Assessment

Identify potential commercial risks:

#### High-Risk Indicators
- No clear comparable titles
- Target audience difficult to reach
- Genre-bending that confuses readers
- Niche within niche positioning
- Trend-dependent appeal

#### Risk Mitigation
