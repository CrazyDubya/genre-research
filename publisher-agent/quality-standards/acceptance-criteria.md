```

### Gate Failure Protocol

When work fails a quality gate:

1. **Document specific failures**
   - What didn't meet standards
   - How far below threshold
   - Examples of issues

2. **Communicate clearly**
   - Specific issues identified
   - Expectations for correction
   - Timeline for revision

3. **Provide path forward**
   - What needs to change
   - Resources if helpful
   - Re-review process

4. **Re-evaluate**
   - Review revised work
   - Assess improvement
   - Make pass/fail decision

## Quality Feedback

### Giving Quality Feedback

Effective feedback is:
- **Specific**: "The pacing slows significantly in Chapter 7" not "Pacing needs work"
- **Actionable**: "Reduce internal monologue by 50%" not "Less thinking"
- **Prioritized**: Critical issues first, nice-to-haves later
- **Balanced**: Acknowledge strengths, address weaknesses
- **Constructive**: Focus on improvement, not criticism

### Feedback Structure

```markdown
## Quality Feedback Format

2. [Issue]: [Specific description] → [Expected fix]

### Important Issues (Should Address)
1. [Issue]: [Specific description] → [Suggestion]
2. [Issue]: [Specific description] → [Suggestion]

### Minor Issues (Consider Addressing)
