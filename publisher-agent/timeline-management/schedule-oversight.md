# Schedule Oversight

Effective timeline management balances accountability with flexibility. This guide covers establishing realistic schedules, monitoring progress, and managing adjustments.

## Schedule Framework

### The Project Timeline Structure

```markdown
## Timeline Components

### Fixed Dates
- Project start
- Final deadline
- External dependencies (if any)

### Milestone Dates
- Calculated from fixed dates
- Include buffer time
- Distributed to enable early issue detection

### Review Periods
- Time allocated for publisher review
- Writer response time
- Iteration cycles

### Buffer Allocation
- Contingency time
- Distributed throughout timeline
- Reserve for final phases
```

### Sample Project Timeline

```markdown
## Standard Novel Timeline (6-month example)

### Month 1: Foundation
- Week 1-2: Project setup, requirements finalization
- Week 3-4: Outline and first chapters (Milestone 1)

### Month 2: Act One
- Week 5-6: Chapters development
- Week 7-8: Act One complete (Milestone 2)

### Month 3: Act Two (First Half)
- Week 9-10: Rising action development
- Week 11-12: Midpoint delivery (Milestone 3)

### Month 4: Act Two (Second Half)
- Week 13-14: Complications and crisis
- Week 15-16: Act Two complete (Milestone 4)

### Month 5: Act Three and First Draft
- Week 17-18: Climax and resolution
- Week 19-20: First draft complete (Milestone 5)

### Month 6: Revision
- Week 21-22: Revision based on feedback
- Week 23-24: Final draft and acceptance (Milestone 6)
```

## Setting Realistic Schedules

### Estimation Factors

Consider when setting timelines:

#### Writer Capacity
- Writing speed (words per day/week)
- Available writing time
- Other commitments
- Historical performance

#### Project Complexity
- Genre demands
- Research requirements
- World-building needs
- Technical complexity

#### Quality Expectations
- Draft quality required
- Revision depth anticipated
- Polish level needed

#### Review Cycles
- Publisher review time needed
- Feedback incorporation time
- Iteration rounds expected

### Buffer Calculation

```markdown
## Buffer Guidelines

### Per-Milestone Buffer
- Add 10-15% to estimated milestone duration
- Example: 2-week milestone = 2-3 extra days

### Phase Buffer
- Add 1 week per month of project duration
- Distributable or accumulated at phase end

### Final Buffer
- Reserve 5-10% of total project time
- Protects final deadline
- Used only when all other buffers exhausted

### Total Buffer Example (6-month project)
- Milestone buffers: ~2 weeks distributed
- Phase buffers: ~1.5 weeks
- Final buffer: ~1.5 weeks
- Total: 5-6 weeks buffer in 6-month timeline
```

## Progress Monitoring

### Tracking Mechanisms

#### Quantitative Tracking

```markdown
## Progress Metrics

### Word Count Tracking
- Current word count
- Target for milestone
- Percentage complete
- Rate vs. required rate

### Milestone Tracking
- Milestones complete
- Current milestone status
- Days until next milestone
- On track / Behind / Ahead

### Timeline Tracking
- Days elapsed
- Days remaining
- Current phase
- Buffer consumed
```

#### Status Indicators

```
GREEN: On track or ahead
- Meeting or exceeding targets
- No significant concerns
- Buffer intact

YELLOW: At risk
- Behind by less than 1 week
- Quality concerns emerging
- Minor buffer consumption

RED: Significant issues
- Behind by more than 1 week
- Quality significantly below target
- Major buffer consumption
- Requires intervention
```

### Check-in Cadence

```markdown
## Monitoring Schedule

### Daily (for Writer)
- Word count tracking
- Self-assessment of progress

### Weekly (Publisher-Writer)
- Progress update
- Blockers identification
- Coming week planning

### At Milestones (Formal Review)
- Deliverable review
- Quality assessment
- Timeline reassessment
- Next milestone confirmation

### Monthly (Project Health)
- Overall trajectory
- Budget/resource status
- Risk assessment
- Stakeholder update
```

## Schedule Adjustment

### When to Adjust

Adjust schedule when:
- Progress consistently behind (not one-off)
- Quality requiring more time than planned
- Scope has legitimately expanded
- External factors intervene
- Continuing current pace will compromise quality

Do NOT adjust when:
- Temporary slow period
- Single milestone slightly delayed
- Writer requests without justification
- To accommodate scope creep

### Adjustment Options

#### Option 1: Extend Timeline
**When:** Quality is paramount, deadline flexible
**Trade-off:** Later delivery, maintained quality
**Process:**
1. Assess delay needed
2. Evaluate downstream impacts
3. Negotiate new timeline
4. Document and communicate

#### Option 2: Reduce Scope
**When:** Deadline fixed, scope flexible
**Trade-off:** Less content, on-time delivery
**Process:**
1. Identify reducible elements
2. Evaluate impact on viability
3. Negotiate scope change
4. Adjust requirements

#### Option 3: Increase Resources
**When:** Budget available, bottleneck addressable
**Trade-off:** Higher cost, maintained timeline and scope
**Process:**
1. Identify resource need
2. Evaluate cost-benefit
3. Acquire resources
4. Integrate and monitor

#### Option 4: Accept Quality Trade-off
**When:** Deadline critical, minimum viable quality achievable
**Trade-off:** Lower quality, on-time delivery
**Process:**
1. Define minimum acceptable quality
2. Evaluate risks
3. Document decision
4. Plan for future improvement

### Adjustment Documentation

```markdown
## Schedule Change Record

**Date:** [Date]
**Original Schedule:** [Description]
**New Schedule:** [Description]
**Reason for Change:** [Detailed explanation]
**Impact Assessment:** [What this affects]
**Approval:** [Who approved]
**Communication:** [Who was notified]
```

## Dependency Management

### Internal Dependencies

Identify and track:
- Chapter sequences (can't write Ch. 10 before Ch. 5)
- Character introductions before use
- World-building before scene setting
- Research completion before writing

### External Dependencies

Manage:
- Publisher review cycles
- Editor availability
- External feedback windows
- Production schedule alignment

### Dependency Tracking

```markdown
## Dependency Matrix

| Task | Depends On | Depended On By | Status |
|------|------------|----------------|--------|
| Ch 1-3 | Outline | Ch 4-8 | Complete |
| Ch 4-8 | Ch 1-3 | Ch 9-15 | In Progress |
| M2 Review | Ch 1-8 | Ch 9+ | Scheduled |
```

## Schedule Recovery

### When Behind Schedule

#### Step 1: Assess Situation
- How far behind?
- What caused the delay?
- Is the cause resolved?
- What's realistic recovery?

#### Step 2: Develop Recovery Plan
- Can buffer absorb delay?
- Can pace increase sustainably?
- Is scope adjustment needed?
- Is deadline adjustment needed?

#### Step 3: Implement Recovery
- Communicate new expectations
- Increase check-in frequency
- Monitor closely
- Adjust as needed

#### Step 4: Prevent Recurrence
- Identify root cause
- Implement prevention
- Document lessons

### Recovery Strategies

#### Short-Term Recovery (< 1 week behind)
- Consume allocated buffer
- Slight pace increase
- Maintain current scope

#### Medium-Term Recovery (1-2 weeks behind)
- Evaluate scope reduction opportunities
- Consider timeline adjustment
- Implement more frequent check-ins
- Address root causes

#### Major Recovery (> 2 weeks behind)
- Formal timeline reassessment
- Scope/quality/timeline negotiation
- Consider project restructuring
- Evaluate project viability

## Timeline Communication

### Stakeholder Updates

Provide regular updates including:
- Current status (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Key accomplishments
- Upcoming milestones
- Risks and mitigations
- Any schedule changes

### Escalation Protocol

Escalate when:
- Status changes to Red
- Timeline change needed
- Quality concerns significant
- Recovery plan failing
