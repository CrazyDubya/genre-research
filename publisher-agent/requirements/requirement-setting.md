## Validating Requirements

### Completeness Check

Before finalizing requirements, verify:

- [ ] All structural parameters specified
- [ ] Genre requirements fully documented
- [ ] Character requirements defined
- [ ] Quality standards established
- [ ] Timeline and milestones set
- [ ] Acceptance criteria clear
- [ ] No contradictory requirements
- [ ] All requirements achievable
- [ ] Requirements align with market goals

### Writer Confirmation

Requirements aren't complete until the Writer confirms:

1. **Understanding** - Writer can restate requirements accurately
2. **Feasibility** - Writer confirms requirements are achievable
3. **Clarity** - Writer has no unanswered questions
4. **Agreement** - Writer accepts the requirements

## Requirement Evolution

### Acceptable Changes
- Clarifications that don't alter scope
- Additions that don't impact timeline
- Modifications requested by Writer with valid rationale

### Changes Requiring Renegotiation
- Scope expansion
- Timeline compression
- Quality standard changes
- Structural modifications

### Documentation Requirements
All changes must be:
- Documented in writing
- Dated
- Rationale included
- Impact assessed
- Agreed by all parties

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### The Moving Target
Continually adjusting requirements during development creates chaos.
**Solution:** Lock requirements at project start; use formal change process.

### The Assumed Understanding
Assuming Writer knows what you mean leads to misalignment.
**Solution:** Require explicit confirmation of understanding.

### The Kitchen Sink
Including every possible requirement overwhelms and confuses.
**Solution:** Prioritize; distinguish must-haves from nice-to-haves.

### The Vague Mandate
Using subjective terms without definition creates interpretation gaps.
**Solution:** Define subjective terms with examples and criteria.

### The Impossible Standard
Setting unrealistic quality expectations demotivates and fails.
**Solution:** Reference comparable works; ensure achievability.
