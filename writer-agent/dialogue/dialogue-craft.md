# Dialogue Craft

Dialogue reveals character, advances plot, and creates engagement. This guide covers techniques for writing compelling, natural dialogue.

## What Dialogue Does

### Functions of Dialogue

1. **Reveals character** - How people speak shows who they are
2. **Advances plot** - Information and actions through speech
3. **Creates conflict** - Characters in verbal opposition
4. **Builds relationships** - Dynamics shown through interaction
5. **Provides exposition** - Information conveyed naturally
6. **Varies pacing** - White space and rhythm change

### Dialogue vs. Real Speech

**Real speech:** Repetitive, aimless, filled with filler, often boring
**Good dialogue:** Sounds like speech, but compressed, purposeful, interesting

Dialogue is the *illusion* of realistic speech, not a transcription.

## Character Voice in Dialogue

### Making Characters Sound Different

Each character needs a distinctive voice:

**Vocabulary:**
- Education level
- Regional/cultural background
- Profession/expertise
- Generation/age

**Rhythm:**
- Long sentences vs. short
- Formal vs. casual
- Complete sentences vs. fragments
- Interrupted vs. flowing

**Patterns:**
- Catchphrases (used sparingly)
- Typical constructions
- What they notice/mention
- Habits of speech

### Voice Consistency

Characters should sound like themselves:
- Across scenes
- Across emotional states (angry character still sounds like that character)
- In dialogue and internal thought
- Unless deliberately changing

### Avoiding Homogenous Dialogue

**Warning signs:**
- All characters sound the same
- Dialogue could be reassigned without notice
- Characters speak in author's voice
- Distinctive traits appear randomly

**Solutions:**
- Write character profiles
- Read dialogue aloud
- Test: cover names, can you identify speaker?
- Study real speech patterns

## Subtext and Indirection

### What Subtext Is

Subtext: What's really being communicated beneath the surface

Characters rarely say exactly what they mean. Good dialogue operates on two levels:
- **Text:** What's actually said
- **Subtext:** What's really meant

### Creating Subtext

**Techniques:**
- Characters talk around difficult topics
- Actions contradict words
- Meaning implied, not stated
- Reader infers from context

**Example - Without subtext:**
"I'm still angry about what you did five years ago and I don't trust you."

**Example - With subtext:**
"You're using the good china tonight."
"It's just dinner."
"Right. Just dinner." She set the knife down precisely. "That's why you spent three hours cooking."

### When Directness Works

Not every line needs subtext:
- Action scenes (clarity needed)
- High-conflict confrontations (after buildup)
- Resolution moments (payoff for subtext)
- Character-appropriate directness

The contrast makes both more effective.

## Dialogue Mechanics

### Dialogue Tags

**"Said" and "asked" are nearly invisible:**
- Use them often
- Don't strain for synonyms
- "Ejaculated" and "expostulated" distract

**Action beats as alternatives:**
- She set down her coffee. "I can't do this anymore."
- Avoids dialogue tags entirely
- Adds physical grounding

**Tag placement:**
- Before: Sets up speaker ("Sarah said, 'Let's go.'")
- Middle: Creates pause ("'I don't,' Sarah said, 'want to discuss this.'")
- After: Default position ("'Let's go,' Sarah said.")
- Absent: When speaker is clear (no tag needed)

### Adverbs in Tags

Generally avoid:
- "he said angrily" - let the words convey emotion
- "she whispered softly" - redundant

**When adverbs work:**
- Contradiction: "I'm fine," she said brokenly.
- Unexpected: "I love you," he said absently.

### Attribution Clarity

Reader should always know who's speaking:
- Tag or beat every few lines
- Maintain consistent dialogue order
- Use distinctive voice to help
- Don't make readers count back

## Dialogue Rhythm and Pacing

### Length and Rhythm

Vary dialogue length:
- Short exchanges: Faster pace, tension
- Long speeches: Emphasis, information
- Mix: Natural conversation

**Fast exchange:**
"You leaving?"
"Yeah."
"When?"
"Now."
"For good?"
She didn't answer.

**Longer speech for effect:**
"I've been thinking about this for six months. Every morning I wake up and I wonder what would happen if I just didn't get out of bed. If I didn't show up to a job I hate, didn't make small talk with people who don't see me, didn't pretend that any of this is what I wanted. And this morning I decided to find out."

### Interruptions and Overlap

**Interruption (em dash):**
"I was going to tell you, but—"
"But nothing. You lied."

**Trailing off (ellipsis):**
"I thought we could maybe..."
"Maybe what?"
"Never mind."

### Beats and Pauses

Use action beats to:
- Create pauses in speech
- Ground dialogue in physical world
- Add character business
- Control pacing

"I know what you did." She folded the letter deliberately, pressing each crease. "I've known for months."

## Exposition Through Dialogue

### The Challenge

Information dump through dialogue sounds false:
"As you know, Bob, we've worked together for fifteen years at this company founded in 1985 by J.D. Morrison, who invented the process we're about to use."

### Natural Information Delivery

**Conflict creates context:**
"You've only been here a year. You don't know how Morrison operates."
"I've been here long enough."

**Questions and requests:**
"Walk me through the process again."
"We've done this a hundred times."
"I know. But I need to hear it."

**Emotional hooks:**
"Remember when Dad used to bring us here? Before everything?"
"That was a long time ago."
"Fifteen years."

### Information Staging

- Reveal information when it matters emotionally
- Break up exposition across scenes
- Let readers discover rather than be told
- Trust readers to follow without overexplaining

## Common Dialogue Problems

### Problem: On-the-Nose Dialogue

**What it is:** Characters say exactly what they mean/feel
**Why it's a problem:** Unnatural, uninteresting, loses subtext

**Solution:** Ask: What would character actually say in this situation? How might they avoid the direct statement?

### Problem: Expositional Dialogue

**What it is:** Characters explain things for reader's benefit
**Why it's a problem:** Unrealistic, boring, obvious

**Solution:** Find natural reasons for information exchange; break up exposition; trust readers

### Problem: Interchangeable Voices

**What it is:** All characters sound the same
**Why it's a problem:** Lack of characterization, unrealistic

**Solution:** Create voice profiles; read aloud; test reassignment

### Problem: Floating Dialogue

**What it is:** Dialogue with no grounding in scene
**Why it's a problem:** Characters feel disembodied

**Solution:** Add action beats, setting details, physical business

### Problem: Overwritten Tags

**What it is:** Too many adverbs, fancy verbs, stage direction
**Why it's a problem:** Distracts from dialogue

**Solution:** Use "said," use action beats, let dialogue carry emotion

## Dialogue in Revision

### Reading Aloud

Read all dialogue aloud:
- Does it sound natural?
- Do characters sound different?
- Is rhythm varied?
- Are there tongue-twisters?

### The Cover Test

Cover character names:
- Can you identify speakers?
- If not, strengthen distinctive elements

### Cut First

Dialogue often improves through cutting:
- Unnecessary filler
- Redundant information
- Overexplained points
- Pleasantries that don't serve

### Check for Purpose

Every exchange should:
- Reveal character, OR
- Advance plot, OR
- Provide needed information

If it does none: cut or combine with scene that does.
