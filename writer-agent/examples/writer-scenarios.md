# Writer Scenarios

Practical examples of applying writing principles in various situations.

## Scenario 1: Starting a New Project

### Situation
You've received requirements from the Publisher for a contemporary romance (85,000 words). You have a premise and characters but haven't started writing.

### Writer Actions

#### Step 1: Internalize Requirements

Read and understand:
- Genre: Contemporary romance
- Length: 85,000 words
- Audience: Adult women 25-45
- Must-haves: Meet-cute by Ch. 3, HEA ending, emotional conflict
- Milestones: Foundation (outline + Ch. 1-3) in 4 weeks

#### Step 2: Prepare Characters

Create character foundations:

```
PROTAGONIST: Maya Chen, 32
- Goal: Prove herself as restaurant head chef
- Internal conflict: Fear of vulnerability after past relationship
- External obstacle: Restaurant's new investor is her ex's best friend
- Voice: Direct, sarcastic humor as defense, softens when she trusts
- What she wants: Professional success
- What she needs: To let people in

LOVE INTEREST: Daniel Torres, 35
- Goal: Prove he's more than family money
- Internal conflict: Imposter syndrome despite competence
- Backstory: Left family business to work in food industry independently
- Voice: Warm, self-deprecating, earnest
- Connection: Respects Maya's talent, sees through her walls
```

#### Step 3: Outline (Light)

Create enough structure to start:

```
ACT ONE (Ch. 1-7)
- Ch. 1: Maya's restaurant crisis (establish competence and stakes)
- Ch. 2: Investor meeting - Daniel arrives (meet-cute with tension)
- Ch. 3: Forced collaboration begins (sparks and friction)
- Ch. 4-7: Working together, attraction builds, backstory reveals

MIDPOINT (Ch. 12-13)
- First kiss or significant vulnerability moment
- External stakes increase (restaurant review coming)

CRISIS (Ch. 18-19)
- Misunderstanding or revelation about past
- Maya retreats to safety

RESOLUTION (Ch. 23-25)
- Grand gesture (appropriate to character)
- HEA achieved
```

#### Step 4: Begin Writing

Start with scene you're excited about (doesn't have to be Ch. 1):

"Write the meet-cute first - I know this scene and it will establish their dynamic. I can layer in Chapter 1's setup after I know their voices."

## Scenario 2: Writing Through Stuck Points

### Situation
You're in Act Two, halfway through the draft. You've written yourself into a corner - the plot requires Maya to attend a family dinner with Daniel, but you've established she has no family in the city.

### Writer Actions

#### Step 1: Don't Panic

This is normal. Drafts have problems. Keep moving.

#### Step 2: Assess Options

**Option A: His family**
The dinner is with Daniel's family, not Maya's. This creates:
- Her as outsider (fish out of water)
- Vulnerability (meeting his family = intimacy escalation)
- Character development (seeing him in family context)

**Option B: Found family**
Establish earlier that her kitchen staff is her family. The dinner is a restaurant team gathering. This creates:
- Consistency with themes
- Maya's world integration
- Lower stakes than meeting "real" family

**Option C: Skip the dinner**
The scene might not be necessary. What was its purpose?
- Purpose: Show intimacy growing
- Alternative: Different vulnerability scene
- Maybe: Private dinner, just the two of them

#### Step 3: Choose and Move On

"Option A works best - Daniel invites her to his family's Sunday dinner. This raises stakes, creates comedy potential, and shows her in vulnerable position. I'll adjust the earlier reference to 'family dinner' to clearly be his family."

#### Step 4: Note for Revision

```
REVISION NOTE: Ch. 8 reference to "family dinner"
needs adjustment - clarify it's Daniel's family.
Also consider: is Maya's no-family-in-city
established clearly enough? Check Ch. 2 and 4.
```

#### Step 5: Keep Writing

Don't revise now. Note the fix needed and continue drafting.

## Scenario 3: Scene Not Working

### Situation
You've written the midpoint scene where Maya and Daniel almost kiss. It's 2,000 words and feels flat. No chemistry, no tension.

### Writer Actions

#### Step 1: Diagnose

Read the scene asking: What's missing?

**Problems identified:**
- They're just talking - no physical action/tension
- The almost-kiss isn't interrupted, it just... happens
- No build-up of tension
- Setting is generic (office)
- Too much interiority, not enough action

#### Step 2: Identify What's Needed

An almost-kiss needs:
- Physical proximity (how do they get close?)
- Tension building (we feel it coming)
- Charged moment (something shifts)
- Interruption or choice (why don't they kiss?)

#### Step 3: Reimagine

**Better version:**
Setting: Restaurant kitchen after hours (home turf for Maya, vulnerability for intimacy)

Build-up:
- They're recipe testing together
- Physical proximity from shared workspace
- Banter escalating with charged subtext
- He reaches across her to grab something
- Their eyes meet

The almost:
- Time seems to stop
- She leans toward him
- Fire alarm goes off (interrupted)
- Moment breaks
- But something has shifted

#### Step 4: Rewrite

Start fresh rather than editing the flat version:

```
Maya was demonstrating knife technique when she felt
him move closer. "You're holding it wrong."

"Show me." He held out the knife, handle first.

Her fingers brushed his as she took it. Neither of
them moved.

"Like this," she said, not looking at the knife.
```

## Scenario 4: Receiving Milestone Feedback

### Situation
Publisher has reviewed Milestone 2 (Act One complete). Feedback: "Romance elements are underdeveloped relative to requirements. The chemistry isn't coming through on the page."

### Writer Actions

#### Step 1: Receive Without Defensiveness

Read all feedback before reacting. Don't argue internally yet.

#### Step 2: Understand the Concern

"Chemistry isn't coming through" could mean:
- Not enough charged moments
- Banter isn't sparkling
- Physical awareness isn't shown
- Too much conflict, not enough connection
- Reader isn't rooting for them yet

#### Step 3: Review Your Work

Reread Act One looking specifically for:
- Moments of genuine connection (found 2, need more)
- Physical awareness (minimal - need more)
- Flirty banter (have conflict banter, not flirty)
- Reasons they're drawn to each other (implied but not shown)
- Reader investment in them together (weak)

#### Step 4: Plan Revisions

```
REVISION PLAN:

Add to Chapter 2 (meet-cute):
- Physical awareness: Maya notices his hands, eyes
- One moment of unexpected connection before conflict

Add to Chapter 4:
- Banter that's flirty, not just combative
- Maya catches herself enjoying his company

Add to Chapter 6:
- Vulnerability moment from Daniel
- Maya sees past his polished exterior

Throughout:
- More physical awareness details
- Soften Maya's walls slightly earlier
- Show why they're drawn to each other, not just thrust together
```

#### Step 5: Revise with Purpose

Make the specific changes needed. Don't over-revise everything.

#### Step 6: Re-Submit

With a brief note:
"Revised per feedback - strengthened romance elements throughout Act One. Added chemistry moments in Chapters 2, 4, and 6. Let me know if further revision needed."

## Scenario 5: Behind on Deadline

### Situation
It's Week 10. Milestone 3 (midpoint, ~40,000 words) is due in 4 days. You have 32,000 words and are stuck on a crucial scene.

### Writer Actions

#### Step 1: Honest Assessment

- Behind by: ~8,000 words (4 days of work at normal pace)
- Stuck scene: Black moment setup (crucial, can't skip)
- Options: Communicate with Publisher vs. push through

#### Step 2: Communicate Early

Don't wait until deadline. Contact Publisher now:

"Update on Milestone 3: I'm at 32,000 words, tracking to approximately 36,000 by due date (vs. 40,000 target). I'm working through a challenging crucial scene. Options:

1. Submit at ~36,000 with note that remaining chapters are drafted
2. Request 3-day extension to deliver complete milestone
3. Other solution you'd prefer

Recommend option 2 for quality, but I can work with whatever serves the project best."

#### Step 3: Get Unstuck

For the stuck scene:
- Write it badly first (get words on page)
- Skip to the scene after (write backward)
- Use placeholder: "[SCENE: Maya confronts Daniel about the investment secret. She feels betrayed. He explains his perspective. They're at an impasse.]"
- Lower your standards temporarily

#### Step 4: Write Strategically

With limited time:
- Focus on essential scenes
- Write lean (can add later)
- Don't polish (revision will come)
- Track scene purposes to prioritize

#### Step 5: Deliver Quality

Better to deliver less content at higher quality than more content that needs major revision.

## Key Patterns Across Scenarios

### Forward Momentum

Keep writing even when:
- Things aren't perfect
- You're unsure about choices
- Earlier problems need fixing
- You don't feel like it

Note problems. Fix them later.

### Requirements Serve the Work

Publisher requirements aren't obstacles:
- They define what readers expect
- They prevent common pitfalls
- They enable focused creativity
- Working within them is craft

### Feedback Is Information

Feedback tells you what isn't working:
- Don't take it personally
- Understand the actual concern
- Address root causes, not symptoms
- Communicate questions

### Writing Is Problem-Solving

Every project has challenges:
- Plot holes
- Flat scenes
- Character issues
- Deadline pressure

The work is finding solutions and keeping going.

### The Draft Gives You Material

Even bad drafts are useful:
- They show you what doesn't work
- They contain raw material
- They can be revised
- A finished draft beats a perfect Chapter 1
