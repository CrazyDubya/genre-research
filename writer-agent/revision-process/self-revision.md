# Self-Revision

Revision transforms raw drafts into polished work. This guide covers revising your own writing effectively before external feedback.

## The Revision Mindset

### Draft vs. Final

The first draft is discovery:
- You're finding the story
- Imperfection is expected
- Momentum matters more than quality
- Problems are data, not failures

Revision is refinement:
- You know the story now
- Quality is the focus
- Patience and precision matter
- Problems get solved

### Revision Truths

1. **Writing is rewriting** - First drafts are raw material
2. **Distance helps** - Time away improves perspective
3. **Reading as reader** - Shift from writer to reader mode
4. **Brave cuts** - Good revision often means deletion
5. **Multiple passes** - One pass can't catch everything

### The Distance Principle

Before revising:
- Set draft aside if possible (days or weeks)
- Work on something else
- Return with fresher eyes
- See what you actually wrote, not what you meant

## Revision Passes

### Pass 1: Big Picture (Developmental)

**Focus:** Structure, plot, character
**Mindset:** Story doctor
**Question:** Does this story work?

Look at:
- Overall structure and pacing
- Plot logic and progression
- Character arcs and consistency
- Theme and coherence
- What's missing or unnecessary

**Don't do yet:** Worry about sentences, fix typos, polish prose

### Pass 2: Scene Level

**Focus:** Scene purpose and execution
**Mindset:** Scene surgeon
**Question:** Does each scene earn its place?

For each scene:
- Does it advance plot or character?
- Does it have conflict/tension?
- Does it enter late and exit early?
- Does it connect to surrounding scenes?
- Could it be cut, combined, or moved?

### Pass 3: Line Editing

**Focus:** Prose quality
**Mindset:** Craft refinement
**Question:** Is every sentence as good as it can be?

Look at:
- Sentence clarity and flow
- Word choice precision
- Rhythm and variety
- Voice consistency
- Unnecessary words

### Pass 4: Technical

**Focus:** Correctness
**Mindset:** Quality control
**Question:** Is everything technically correct?

Check:
- Grammar and punctuation
- Spelling
- Consistency (names, details)
- Formatting
- Continuity

## Developmental Self-Edit

### Reading for Story

Read your manuscript like a reader:
- Start to finish, ideally in few sittings
- Note engagement levels (where do you get bored?)
- Track confusion points
- Mark emotional responses
- Don't fix yet—just note

### Structure Assessment

After reading, ask:
- Does Act One hook and set up effectively?
- Does Act Two maintain momentum?
- Does Act Three pay off?
- Is the midpoint effective?
- Does the ending satisfy?

### Plot Check

Verify:
- Central conflict sustains throughout
- Cause and effect logic holds
- All plot threads resolve
- Stakes escalate appropriately
- Ending is earned

### Character Check

Verify:
- Protagonist is compelling and active
- Character arc is present and earned
- Motivations are clear
- Consistency is maintained
- Supporting characters serve purpose

### The Ruthless Question

For every scene, chapter, subplot: **"Would the story work without this?"**

If yes → consider cutting
If no → keep and strengthen

## Scene-Level Self-Edit

### Scene Purpose Test

For each scene, identify:
1. What is its purpose? (plot/character/information)
2. What changes? (before → after)
3. What is the conflict?

Scenes failing this test need revision or cutting.

### Entry and Exit Check

- Does the scene start as late as possible?
- Does it end as early as possible?
- Could beginning/ending be trimmed?

### Balance Assessment

Does the scene have appropriate:
- Action (events happening)
- Dialogue (characters speaking)
- Description (grounding in world)
- Interiority (access to thoughts/feelings)

## Line-Level Self-Edit

### Reading Aloud

Read prose aloud:
- Awkward spots become obvious
- Rhythm problems reveal themselves
- Dialogue sounds natural or doesn't
- Ear catches what eye misses

### Word-Level Checks

**Eliminate:**
- Filler words (just, very, really, quite)
- Redundancies (past history, completely destroyed)
- Throat-clearing openers
- Unnecessary qualifiers

**Strengthen:**
- Vague words → specific words
- Passive voice → active voice
- Weak verbs → strong verbs
- Generic nouns → specific nouns

### Sentence-Level Checks

- Is meaning clear on first read?
- Could sentence be shorter?
- Does rhythm serve content?
- Is variety present?

### Paragraph-Level Checks

- Does each paragraph have purpose?
- Are paragraphs appropriate length?
- Do transitions work?
- Is emphasis falling correctly?

## Killing Darlings

### What "Kill Your Darlings" Means

The phrase means: Be willing to cut material you love if it doesn't serve the story.

**Darlings include:**
- Beautifully written passages that don't fit
- Clever dialogue that doesn't advance
- Favorite scenes that don't earn their place
- Subplots you love but story doesn't need

### How to Know

Ask:
- Does this serve the story?
- Am I keeping it because it works, or because I love it?
- Would a reader miss it?
- Does cutting it hurt only me, or the book?

### Saving Darlings

If you cut something good:
- Save it in a separate file
- Maybe it fits elsewhere
- Maybe it's for another project
- Let it go if not

## Responding to Your Own Concerns

### When Something Feels Wrong

Trust your instincts:
- "Something's off here" → investigate
- Mark suspicious passages
- Come back with fresh eyes
- Ask what the problem actually is

### Common Writer Blind Spots

**What's in your head vs. on page:**
- You know character backstory; reader doesn't
- You see connections; reader might not
- Your intentions may not be clear in text

**Solution:** Read as if you don't know the story

**Repetition blindness:**
- Words/phrases you overuse
- Patterns you don't notice
- Crutches you rely on

**Solution:** Search for your common crutches

**Pacing errors:**
- Sections feel slow because you wrote them slowly
- Sections feel rushed because you wrote them fast

**Solution:** Time your reading; note actual pace

## Revision Techniques

### The Fresh Eyes Trick

If you can't wait for distance:
- Change font/formatting
- Print and read on paper
- Read in different location
- Read at different time of day

### The Reverse Outline

After drafting, outline what you wrote:
- Chapter by chapter
- Scene by scene
- Note purpose of each

This reveals:
- Structural problems
- Missing elements
- Unnecessary scenes
- Pacing issues

### The Read-Through

Read entire manuscript:
- In as few sittings as possible
- Without stopping to fix
- Marking only (asterisks, highlights)
- Note emotional experience

### The Question Pass

Read asking one question only:
- "Is this character consistent?"
- "Does the pacing work?"
- "Is the voice right?"

Focused passes catch specific issues.

## When to Stop Revising

### Signs You're Done

- Changes are lateral, not improvements
- You're second-guessing previous improvements
- The work meets your goals
- Fresh readers confirm quality
- You're polishing polish

### Signs to Keep Going

- Major structural issues remain
- Confusion points exist
- Emotional beats aren't landing
- Voice isn't consistent
- Standards aren't met

### Diminishing Returns

Every pass has less impact:
- First passes: major improvements
- Later passes: refinements
- Eventually: diminishing returns
- Know when to stop
