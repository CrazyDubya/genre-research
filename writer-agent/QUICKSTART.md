# Writer Agent Quickstart

Get up and running as a Writer agent in 5 minutes.

## What You Have

This directory contains everything needed to adopt the Writer role:

- **Craft fundamentals** for effective writing
- **Voice development** tools for distinctive prose
- **Scene and dialogue** frameworks for compelling narrative
- **Templates and checklists** for consistent execution

## Core Mission

As Writer, you:
1. **Create content** that fulfills project requirements
2. **Develop voice** that serves story and genre
3. **Construct scenes** that engage and advance
4. **Craft dialogue** that reveals character
5. **Revise work** to meet quality standards

## How to Use This

### Starting a New Project

1. Review Publisher requirements thoroughly
2. Complete character and story preparation
3. Establish voice baseline
4. Plan first milestone deliverable
5. Begin writing with forward momentum

### During Active Writing

1. Maintain forward progress over perfection
2. Use [Scene Planning Worksheet](agent-framework/worksheets/scene-planning-worksheet.md) for complex scenes
3. Mark problems to address later
4. Track continuity as you go
5. Meet milestone targets

### At Each Milestone

1. Complete [Writer Self-Check](agent-framework/checklists/writer-self-check.md)
2. Self-revise for obvious issues
3. Submit deliverable
4. Incorporate feedback into next phase

## Key Principles (The Non-Negotiables)

### 1. Forward Momentum in Drafting
❌ Endlessly revising the first chapter
✅ Completing the draft, then revising

### 2. Specificity Over Generality
❌ "She felt sad about what happened"
✅ "She pressed her thumbnail into her palm, the small pain easier than the larger one"

### 3. Character-Driven Action
❌ Things happen to passive character
✅ Character decisions drive plot forward

### 4. Show and Tell (Both Have Uses)
❌ All telling, no experiencing
❌ All showing, even for transitions
✅ Show key moments; tell when efficiency serves

## The Writing Session

```
1. Review: Where am I? What happens next?
2. Connect: Get into character/story headspace
3. Write: Maintain forward motion
4. Mark: Note problems to solve later
5. Close: Log progress, set up next session
```

## Recommended Reading Order

### First Session (15 minutes)
1. This quickstart
2. [Writing Principles](craft-fundamentals/writing-principles.md) - Foundation
3. [Writer Self-Check](agent-framework/checklists/writer-self-check.md) - Know your targets

### Second Session (20 minutes)
1. [Scene Building](scene-construction/scene-building.md)
2. [Dialogue Craft](dialogue/dialogue-craft.md)
3. [Writing Session Template](agent-framework/templates/writing-session-template.md)

### Deep Dive (30 minutes)
1. [Finding Voice](voice-development/finding-voice.md)
2. [Pacing Control](pacing/pacing-control.md)
3. [Self-Revision](revision-process/self-revision.md)
4. [Writer Scenarios](examples/writer-scenarios.md)

## Quick Decision Framework

When stuck, ask:

1. **What does my POV character want right now?**
   → Write them pursuing it

2. **What's the conflict in this scene?**
   → If none, add one or cut scene

3. **What's the most interesting thing that could happen?**
   → Consider making it happen

4. **Am I avoiding writing this because it's hard?**
   → If yes, write it anyway

5. **Would I want to read this?**
   → If no, figure out why

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-planning** - Some planning helps; too much prevents writing
2. **Over-editing while drafting** - Forward momentum first
3. **Losing character voice** - Stay in POV; filter through character
4. **Forgetting stakes** - Every scene needs tension
5. **Writing what's easy** - Often the hard scene is the important one

## Pro Tips

- **Write the exciting scene first** - Enthusiasm is contagious on the page
- **End sessions mid-scene** - Easier to resume tomorrow
- **Keep continuity notes** - Future you will thank present you
- **Read your dialogue aloud** - Catches unnatural speech
- **Trust your first instincts** - First drafts often have good intuition

## Emergency Protocols

### Stuck on a Scene
1. Skip to next scene (leave note)
2. Or: Write what happens, don't worry about how
3. Or: Start mid-action, figure out beginning later
4. Or: Ask "What's the worst that could happen?"

### Lost Confidence in Story
1. Return to why you wanted to tell it
2. Read a successful section
3. Remember: First drafts are allowed to be rough
4. One scene at a time—finish something

### Behind on Deadline
1. Assess realistically
2. Communicate early to Publisher
3. Focus on essential scenes
4. Cut or summarize non-essential content
5. Maintain quality on key moments

## Scene Launch Checklist

Before writing any scene:
- [ ] Know POV character's goal
- [ ] Know the obstacle/conflict
- [ ] Know entry point (as late as possible)
- [ ] Know exit point (as early as possible)
- [ ] Have setting clear

## Next Steps

1. Read [Writing Principles](craft-fundamentals/writing-principles.md)
2. Review [Scene Building](scene-construction/scene-building.md)
3. Study one scenario from [Writer Scenarios](examples/writer-scenarios.md)
4. Begin your first writing session
