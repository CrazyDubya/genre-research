# Writing Principles

The foundational principles of effective fiction writing. These principles inform craft decisions at every level from word choice to story structure.

## Show vs. Tell

### Understanding the Distinction

**Showing:** Creating experience through scene, sensory detail, and implication
**Telling:** Stating information directly through summary or exposition

**Example - Telling:**
"Sarah was nervous about the interview."

**Example - Showing:**
"Sarah smoothed her skirt for the fourth time. The elevator buttons blurred as she tried to remember which floor—twelve or thirteen?—and she punched both."

### When Each Applies

**Show when:**
- The moment is emotionally significant
- Reader engagement is crucial
- Character development is happening
- Stakes are high
- You want readers to experience rather than understand

**Tell when:**
- Transitioning between scenes
- Summarizing necessary background
- Providing context efficiently
- The information is needed but not dramatic
- Pacing requires compression

### The Balance

Most effective writing uses both strategically:
- Major scenes: primarily show
- Transitions: primarily tell
- Within scenes: show key beats, tell connective tissue

**Example of blend:**
"The meeting lasted three hours. [Tell: efficient summary] When it ended, Sarah's hands were shaking so badly she couldn't press the elevator button. [Show: key emotional detail]"

## Tension and Conflict

### The Role of Conflict

Conflict is the engine of story. Without it:
- Readers disengage
- Plot stalls
- Characters feel static
- Scenes feel pointless

### Types of Conflict

1. **Character vs. Character** - Interpersonal opposition
2. **Character vs. Self** - Internal struggle
3. **Character vs. Environment** - External circumstance
4. **Character vs. Society** - Cultural/systemic opposition
5. **Character vs. Nature** - Environmental threat
6. **Character vs. Fate/Supernatural** - Cosmic forces

Most stories layer multiple types.

### Tension vs. Conflict

**Conflict:** Actual opposition or struggle
**Tension:** The sense that something matters, could go wrong, or is at stake

Tension can exist without active conflict:
- Anticipation of conflict
- Unspoken friction
- Reader knowledge characters lack
- Suspense about outcomes

### Creating Scene-Level Tension

Every scene needs:
- Someone who wants something
- Something preventing easy achievement
- Stakes (why it matters)
- Uncertainty about outcome

Even quiet scenes should have tension:
- Underlying relationship dynamics
- Unspoken thoughts
- External pressures
- Questions unanswered

## Character-Driven Narrative

### Characters as Engine

Plot should emerge from character:
- Decisions characters make
- Actions characters take
- Conflicts between characters
- Character response to circumstance

**Character-driven:** Maria's obsession with justice leads her to investigate, causing danger.
**Plot-driven:** Events happen to Maria who reacts until she solves it.

### Character Agency

Protagonists should be active, not passive:
- Making decisions (not just having things happen)
- Driving plot forward
- Causing consequences through action
- Changing their circumstances through effort

### Consistency and Surprise

Characters should be:
- **Consistent** enough to be believable
- **Surprising** enough to be interesting

The best surprises are consistent in retrospect:
"I didn't see it coming, but now it makes perfect sense."

### Character Interiority

Give readers access to:
- Character thoughts and feelings
- Character interpretations
- Character voice
- Character-specific worldview

This creates connection and understanding.

## Specificity and Concrete Detail

### Why Specificity Works

Specific beats generic:
- More vivid and memorable
- Creates authentic experience
- Reveals character
- Grounds readers in scene
- Does more work with fewer words

### Generic vs. Specific

| Generic | Specific |
|---------|----------|
| She drove a nice car | She drove a decade-old Civic with a "My Other Car Is the Millennium Falcon" bumper sticker |
| He ate dinner | He pushed the peas around his plate, building a wall between them and the mashed potatoes |
| The room was messy | Three half-empty coffee cups grew mold on the desk; she couldn't remember which one was from today |

### The Telling Detail

One perfect detail can evoke more than exhaustive description:
- Choose details that reveal character or situation
- Details that do double-duty are most efficient
- The specific suggests the general

**Example:**
"She noticed the books in his apartment were alphabetized by author and organized by color within each letter."

This single detail tells us more about him than paragraphs of description.

### Sensory Specificity

Engage multiple senses:
- **Sight:** Most common, but be precise
- **Sound:** Often overlooked, very evocative
- **Touch/Physical sensation:** Creates embodiment
- **Smell:** Strongly linked to memory and emotion
- **Taste:** Specific and memorable

## Emotional Truth

### What Emotional Truth Means

Writing that rings true emotionally:
- Authentic to human experience
- Earns its emotional moments
- Avoids sentimentality
- Trusts readers to feel

### Earning Emotion

Emotional impact requires setup:
- Build investment before testing it
- Create stakes before threatening them
- Establish relationship before testing it
- Let readers anticipate before delivering

Unearned emotion:
- Character we just met dies tragically
- Love confession after two scenes together
- Sacrifice before establishing what's valued

### Avoiding Sentimentality

**Sentimentality:** Emotion disproportionate to cause; unearned emotional manipulation

Signs of sentimentality:
- Telling readers how to feel
- Musical swelling in prose form
- Excessive focus on emotional response
- Death/suffering as emotional shortcut
- Cute or convenient emotional beats

The fix:
- Trust the scene to create emotion
- Understate rather than overstate
- Earn moments through setup
- Be honest about complexity

### Complexity of Emotion

Real emotion is rarely pure:
- Mix grief with relief
- Mix love with frustration
- Mix triumph with loss
- Let contradictions exist

This complexity creates authenticity.

## Additional Core Principles

### The Iceberg Theory

Readers feel what's beneath the surface:
- Not everything needs to be stated
- Implication can be powerful
- Subtext enriches text
- Trust readers to understand

### Enter Late, Leave Early

Scenes should:
- Begin as late as possible (skip setup)
- End as early as possible (skip trailing action)
- Cut the throat-clearing
- Trust readers to bridge gaps

### Every Scene Earns Its Place

Scenes should:
- Advance plot, OR
- Develop character, OR
- Provide essential information
- (Ideally: do multiple)

If a scene does none of these, cut it.

### The First Draft Is Discovery

First drafts:
- Reveal the story to you
- Are allowed to be imperfect
- Benefit from momentum over precision
- Will be revised

Don't judge draft by final standards.

### Revision Is Where Writing Happens

First drafts are raw material:
- Structure is refined
- Prose is polished
- Errors are corrected
- Story is discovered and improved

Writing is rewriting.

## Applying These Principles

### During Drafting

- Keep principles in mind
- Don't let them paralyze
- Mark places to apply later
- Trust revision

### During Revision

- Use principles as diagnostic tools
- Apply deliberately
- Evaluate effectiveness
- Iterate

### Continuous Practice

- Study these principles in action
- Notice when published authors apply them
- Practice deliberately
- Develop intuition over time
