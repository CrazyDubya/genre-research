# Scene Building

Scenes are the fundamental unit of fiction. This guide covers constructing effective scenes that engage readers and advance your story.

## What Scenes Do

### Scene Purpose

Every scene must:
1. **Advance plot** (something changes), AND/OR
2. **Develop character** (we learn/understand more), AND/OR
3. **Provide essential information** (readers need this to follow)

Ideally: do multiple things simultaneously.

If a scene does none of these: **cut it.**

### The Scene Question

Before writing any scene, know:
- What is the **POV character's goal** in this scene?
- What is the **conflict/obstacle**?
- What **changes** by the end?
- Why does this scene **matter**?

## Scene Structure

### Classic Scene Structure

**Goal → Conflict → Disaster/Resolution**

1. **Goal:** Character wants something
2. **Conflict:** Something prevents easy achievement
3. **Outcome:** Success, failure, or complication

The outcome should lead to the next scene's goal.

### Scene and Sequel

A useful pattern:

**Scene:** External action, goal pursuit, conflict
**Sequel:** Emotional reaction, processing, decision

Not every scene needs explicit sequel; sometimes compressed or implied.

**Scene Example:**
Maria confronts her sister about the stolen money. Conflict escalates. Sister admits theft but won't return the money.

**Sequel Example:**
Maria drives home, processing. Anger becomes determination. She decides to go to the police.

### Beat Structure Within Scenes

Scenes are made of beats—smaller units of action/reaction:
- A beat is one action and its response
- Beats build and compound
- Tension rises through escalating beats
- Culminates in scene climax

## Scene Elements

### Entry Point

**Enter late:** Start as close to the action as possible
- Skip setup that can be implied
- Don't show character traveling to scene
- Begin mid-action when possible
- Trust readers to orient

**Opening hooks:**
- Immediate conflict or tension
- Intriguing statement or action
- Mystery or question
- Change or surprise

### Exit Point

**Leave early:** End before action fully resolves
- Exit on high point or hook
- Don't follow characters away from scene
- Trust readers to bridge gaps
- Create momentum to next scene

**Closing techniques:**
- Cliffhanger
- Revelation
- Decision/commitment
- Resonant image or line

### Balance of Elements

Scenes typically include:
- **Action:** Physical movement, events
- **Dialogue:** Character speech
- **Description:** Setting, appearance, atmosphere
- **Interiority:** Thoughts, feelings, reactions

**Balance varies by:**
- Scene type (action scene: more action)
- Genre (romance: more interiority)
- Story phase (climax: less description)
- Purpose (exposition scene: more dialogue)

## Scene Types

### Action Scenes

**Characteristics:**
- Focus on physical events
- Compressed time (moment-by-moment)
- Short sentences, urgent rhythm
- Minimal interiority during action
- Stakes clear and immediate

**Keys to success:**
- Choreograph clearly
- Maintain spatial awareness
- Balance action with beats
- Create genuine stakes
- Don't let reader confusion kill tension

### Dialogue Scenes

**Characteristics:**
- Conversation drives scene
- Character dynamics revealed
- Information exchanged
- Subtext operates

**Keys to success:**
- Give characters competing goals
- Use action beats for pacing
- Include interiority
- Ground in setting
- Avoid talking heads

### Emotional/Interior Scenes

**Characteristics:**
- Focus on character's inner experience
- Processing events
- Relationship development
- Thematic exploration

**Keys to success:**
- Anchor in concrete details
- Avoid navel-gazing
- Keep some external action
- Make interiority interesting
- Earn the reflective space

### Exposition Scenes

**Characteristics:**
- Information transfer primary goal
- World-building or backstory
- Setup for later

**Keys to success:**
- Disguise information as scene
- Add conflict/tension
- Break up with action
- Trust reader to follow without overexplaining
- Only include essential information

## Creating Tension in Scenes

### Conflict Sources

- Character vs. character (most common)
- Character vs. environment
- Character vs. internal struggle
- Subtext and unspoken friction
- Reader knowledge (dramatic irony)

### Tension Techniques

**Time pressure:** Something must happen soon
**Stakes clarity:** We know what's at risk
**Obstacles:** Difficulty increases
**Uncertainty:** Outcome not assured
**Competing desires:** Want vs. should, goal vs. goal

### Tension Management

Tension should:
- Build within scene
- Vary across scenes
- Peak at climactic moments
- Release appropriately after peaks

**Micro-tension:** Sentence to sentence uncertainty about what's next
**Macro-tension:** Scene to scene uncertainty about larger outcomes

## Scene Planning

### Pre-Writing Questions

1. **POV:** Whose scene is this?
2. **Goal:** What does the POV character want?
3. **Conflict:** What opposes them?
4. **Stakes:** Why does it matter?
5. **Outcome:** What changes?
6. **Entry:** Where do I start?
7. **Exit:** Where do I end?

### Scene Sketch

Quick planning format:
```
SCENE: [One-line description]
POV: [Character]
GOAL: [What they want]
CONFLICT: [What opposes]
OUTCOME: [How it ends]
CHANGE: [What's different after]
NOTES: [Key moments to hit]
```

### When to Plan vs. Discover

**Planning helps when:**
- Scene is complex
- Multiple elements to balance
- Part of crucial plot mechanics
- You're stuck

**Discovery works when:**
- You know the scene well
- Characters are speaking to you
- Scene is emotional/character-focused
- Planning kills your momentum

## Common Scene Problems

### Problem: Nothing Happens

**Cause:** No conflict, no change
**Solution:** Add conflict; ensure something shifts

### Problem: Scene Goes Nowhere

**Cause:** No goal, unclear purpose
**Solution:** Identify what scene needs to accomplish; add POV goal

### Problem: Talking Heads

**Cause:** Dialogue without grounding
**Solution:** Add action, setting, interiority, physical beats

### Problem: Scene Too Long

**Cause:** Late entry, early exit not applied; unnecessary content
**Solution:** Cut opening, cut ending, remove unnecessary beats

### Problem: Confusing Action

**Cause:** Poor choreography, unclear spatial relationships
**Solution:** Track positions, use concrete directions, test with reader

### Problem: Boring

**Cause:** No tension, predictable, stakes unclear
**Solution:** Add conflict, raise stakes, create uncertainty
