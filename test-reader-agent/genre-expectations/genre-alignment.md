# Genre Alignment

Readers come to genres with specific expectations. This guide covers evaluating how well a manuscript delivers on genre promises.

## Understanding Genre Expectations

### What Genre Promises

Every genre makes implicit promises:
- Emotional experience type
- Story elements included
- Conventions followed
- Resolution style
- Reader satisfaction requirements

### Genre Contract

When readers pick up a genre book, they expect:
- The core genre experience
- Required genre elements
- Appropriate tone
- Satisfying genre-specific ending

Breaking this contract feels like betrayal.

## Evaluating Genre Delivery

### Core Experience Check

Ask yourself:
- Did I get the core genre experience?
- Did it feel like [genre]?
- Would genre fans be satisfied?

### Element Checklist

For each required element:
- Is it present?
- Is it executed well?
- Does it satisfy?

### Convention Assessment

Genre conventions:
- Which were followed?
- Which were subverted?
- Did subversions work?
- Did missing conventions hurt?

### Ending Evaluation

Genre-specific endings:
- Does ending fit genre requirements?
- Is it satisfying for this genre?
- Does it honor the genre contract?

## Genre Subversion

### When Subversion Works

Subverting expectations can work when:
- The subversion serves the story
- It delivers something better
- Readers feel delighted, not cheated
- Core satisfactions are still met

### When Subversion Fails

Subversion fails when:
- Core expectations are broken without replacement
- Readers feel tricked or cheated
- The alternative isn't satisfying
- It seems like the author didn't understand the genre

### Example: Romance

**Works:** Subverting the "big misunderstanding" trope by having characters actually communicate
**Fails:** Ending without HEA/HFN (breaks core contract)

### Reporting on Subversion

When you notice subversion:
- Note what convention was subverted
- Report whether it worked for you
- Explain why/why not
- Consider how target readers would respond

## Crossover and Blended Genres

### Managing Multiple Genre Expectations

When genres blend:
- Identify primary and secondary genres
- Evaluate each set of expectations
- Note balance between genres
- Assess if both are satisfied

### Common Blend Issues

- One genre dominates, leaving other unsatisfied
- Neither genre fully delivered
- Expectations conflict
- Ending serves one but not other

### Evaluating Blends

Ask:
- What genres does this claim to be?
- Are both genre experiences delivered?
- Which feels primary?
- Are both satisfied by the ending?

## Comparable Titles

### Using Comps for Evaluation

If comparable titles are identified:
- Have you read them?
- How does this compare?
- Does it deliver similar satisfaction?
- Does it meet similar expectations?

### Benchmarking

Compare to successful genre entries:
- What did they deliver that this does/doesn't?
- How does execution compare?
- Would fans of comps enjoy this?

## Genre Feedback Format

### Reporting Genre Alignment

Structure your genre feedback:

**Genre identification:**
"This reads as [genre/subgenre]."

**Core experience delivery:**
"The core genre experience was [present/partially present/missing]."

**Element assessment:**
"Required elements: [list with assessment]"

**Satisfaction level:**
"As a [genre] reader, I was [satisfied/partially satisfied/unsatisfied] because..."

**Subversion notes (if applicable):**
"The story subverts [convention] by [description]. This [worked/didn't work] because..."

**Overall genre fit:**
"This [would/would not] satisfy [genre] readers because..."

## Common Genre Feedback

### Romance Issues

"The romance elements are underdeveloped. By Chapter 10, I wasn't convinced these characters should be together—there's attraction and banter, but not the emotional connection romance readers expect. The ending technically delivers HEA, but it doesn't feel earned."

### Thriller Issues

"The threat doesn't feel credible. The antagonist's plan has obvious holes, and I never felt genuine tension about the outcome. By Chapter 12, I was confident the protagonist would be fine, which killed the suspense."

### Mystery Issues

"The solution relies on information the reader didn't have. The crucial clue (the timetable) is revealed in the denouement but never shown earlier. This feels unfair—I should have been able to figure it out."

### Fantasy Issues

"The magic system contradicts itself. In Chapter 5, it's established that magic requires physical exhaustion, but in Chapter 18, the protagonist casts repeatedly with no consequences. This broke my immersion."

### Horror Issues

"I was never scared. The atmosphere attempts were there, but the threat felt abstract and distant. By Chapter 7, I was more curious than frightened, which I don't think was the intent."
