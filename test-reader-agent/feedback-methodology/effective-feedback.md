# Effective Feedback

Providing useful reader feedback requires specific methodology. This guide covers how to give feedback that helps writers and editors improve the manuscript.

## The Feedback Mindset

### Your Role

As Test Reader, you are:
- An experience reporter
- An engagement tracker
- A confusion detector
- An audience proxy

You are NOT:
- An editor
- A writing coach
- A problem solver
- A gatekeeper

### Descriptive vs. Prescriptive

**Descriptive (your job):** "I was confused when Sarah appeared—I thought she was still in Paris."

**Prescriptive (not your job):** "You should add a scene showing Sarah traveling back."

Report the problem. Let Writer/Editor determine the solution.

### Why This Matters

Writers need to understand:
- What readers experience
- Where problems occur
- The nature of problems
- The severity of problems

They don't need readers to:
- Tell them how to write
- Prescribe solutions
- Edit their work
- Rewrite their scenes

## The Feedback Formula

### Location + Effect + Intensity

Every piece of feedback should include:

**Location:** Where exactly did this occur?
- Chapter number
- Scene or page reference
- Specific paragraph/line if possible

**Effect:** What was the impact on you?
- Confused
- Bored
- Disbelieving
- Emotionally moved
- Engaged
- Lost

**Intensity:** How strong was the effect?
- Mild / Moderate / Strong
- Brief / Sustained
- Recoverable / Permanent damage

### Example Format

"**Chapter 7, the diner scene:** I was moderately confused about the timeline—this seems to happen the same day as Chapter 6 but the references suggest a week has passed. It took me out of the story briefly."

## Categories of Feedback

### Engagement Feedback

Report on your reading engagement:
- Where you were hooked
- Where interest waned
- Where you wanted to stop
- Where you couldn't stop
- Overall engagement level

### Emotional Feedback

Report on emotional responses:
- What emotions you felt
- When you felt them
- When emotions failed to trigger
- When emotions felt earned/unearned
- Overall emotional satisfaction

### Confusion Feedback

Report on clarity issues:
- What confused you
- When confusion occurred
- Whether it resolved
- How long it took to resolve
- Impact on experience

### Believability Feedback

Report on suspension of disbelief:
- What you didn't believe
- Why it didn't work
- Impact on story experience
- Whether you recovered

### Pacing Feedback

Report on story rhythm:
- Where pacing felt right
- Where it dragged
- Where it rushed
- Overall pacing assessment

### Satisfaction Feedback

Report on fulfillment:
- Expectations met or not
- Genre requirements satisfied
- Ending satisfaction
- Would you recommend it?

## Feedback Prioritization

### Critical Issues

Issues that break the reading experience:
- Major confusion that doesn't resolve
- Complete loss of engagement
- Fundamental believability problems
- Structural issues affecting story
- Ending that doesn't satisfy

### Important Issues

Issues that significantly affect experience:
- Repeated minor confusions
- Extended slow sections
- Character behavior problems
- Emotional moments that don't land
- Genre expectations partially unmet

### Minor Issues

Issues worth noting but not major:
- Brief confusion that resolved
- Occasional slow moments
- Personal taste concerns
- Small believability hiccups

### Taste vs. Problem

Distinguish clearly:
- **Problem:** Would affect most readers
- **Taste:** Only affects readers with specific preferences

Note which is which in your feedback.

## Pattern Identification

### Single vs. Recurring

One instance might be:
- Intentional
- Coincidental
- Minor

Multiple instances are:
- A pattern
- Likely significant
- Worth highlighting

### Naming Patterns

When you see patterns:
- Name the pattern
- List instances
- Note cumulative effect
- Assess severity

Example: "There's a pattern of the protagonist's thoughts interrupting action sequences. This happened in Chapter 4 (fight scene), Chapter 8 (chase), and Chapter 14 (confrontation). It slows the pacing and reduces tension each time."

### Pattern Priorities

Patterns are usually more important than single instances:
- Suggest systematic issues
- Have greater impact
- Require structural attention
- Can't be dismissed as one-off

## Constructive Framing

### Honest but Kind

Being constructive doesn't mean:
- Hiding problems
- Softening important issues
- Pretending things are better than they are

It does mean:
- Respectful language
- Problem-focused, not person-focused
- Balanced perspective
- Helpful intent

### The Feedback Sandwich (Used Wisely)

Don't artificially sandwich criticism with praise.
Do ensure you report what works alongside what doesn't.

Readers need to know:
- What to keep doing
- What resonated
- What worked well

This isn't sugar-coating; it's complete feedback.

### Depersonalizing Feedback

**Personal:** "You didn't make me care about the character."
**Depersonalized:** "I wasn't invested in the character by Chapter 3."

Focus on your experience, not their failure.

## Feedback Structure

### Organizing Your Report

Structure feedback for usability:

1. **Overall Impressions** - Big picture first
2. **Major Concerns** - Critical and important issues
3. **Detailed Notes** - Scene-by-scene or chapter-by-chapter
4. **Patterns Observed** - Recurring issues
5. **Strengths** - What worked well
6. **Audience Fit** - Target reader assessment

### Quantifying When Possible

Numbers help:
- "Confused 4 times in Chapter 5"
- "Lost interest for approximately 3 chapters"
- "Would rate engagement 7/10 overall"
- "Cried twice, laughed once"

### Referencing Specifics

Always reference:
- Chapter numbers
- Scene descriptions ("the restaurant argument")
- Page/location if possible
- Character names involved

## Feedback Delivery

### Written Reports

For formal feedback:
- Use structured template
- Include all categories
- Prioritize clearly
- Be specific throughout

### Discussing Feedback

If discussing with Writer:
- Let them read written feedback first
- Answer questions about your experience
- Don't prescribe solutions
- Support their process

### When Asked "What Should I Do?"

Redirect to experience:
- "I can tell you what I felt, but the solution is your call"
- "My confusion was about X—you'll know best how to address that"
- "I'm reporting the reader experience; you and your editor are the craft experts"

## Common Feedback Mistakes

### Being Too Nice

Hiding problems doesn't help:
- Writers need to know issues
- Undiscovered problems remain
- Honesty serves the work

### Being Too Harsh

Criticism without construction hurts:
- Damages relationship
- Obscures useful information
- Demoralizes without helping

### Being Too Vague

"I liked it" or "Something felt off" is useless:
- Specificity enables action
- Vague feedback can't be addressed
- Details matter

### Prescribing Solutions

"You should add a scene where..." is overstepping:
- You're not the writer
- Many solutions exist
- Your solution may not be best
- It's not your role

### Forgetting Audience

Feedback from wrong perspective is misleading:
- Know the target audience
- Read as that audience
- Note when you differ
- Adjust accordingly

## Feedback Examples

### Poor Feedback
"The middle was slow."

### Better Feedback
"Chapters 10-14 felt slow. My engagement dropped significantly. I found myself skimming through Chapter 12 (the shopping trip scene) and Chapter 13 (the internal monologue about her mother)."

### Poor Feedback
"The romance wasn't convincing."

### Better Feedback
"By Chapter 8, I wasn't convinced by the romantic connection. The leads have conflict and chemistry in their banter, but I didn't see vulnerability or genuine connection—just attraction and arguing. The 'I love you' in Chapter 15 felt unearned because of this."

### Poor Feedback
"Great ending!"

### Better Feedback
"The ending worked for me. The final confrontation felt tense (I was genuinely worried about the outcome), and the resolution gave me the emotional payoff I'd been building toward since Chapter 3. The last line stuck with me."
