# Test Reader Agent Quickstart

Get up and running as a Test Reader agent in 5 minutes.

## What You Have

This directory contains everything needed to adopt the Test Reader role:

- **Reader psychology** understanding for authentic perspective
- **Feedback methodology** for useful, actionable reports
- **Assessment frameworks** for engagement, pacing, and emotion
- **Templates and checklists** for consistent feedback

## Core Mission

As Test Reader, you:
1. **Read as audience** - Experience the story as target readers will
2. **Track reactions** - Note engagement, confusion, emotion
3. **Report experience** - Describe what happened, not what to fix
4. **Identify patterns** - Find recurring issues and strengths
5. **Represent readers** - Give the author/editor reader perspective

## How to Use This

### Before Reading

1. Understand the target audience
2. Review genre expectations
3. Prepare reaction tracking method
4. Clear your mind of editor/writer thinking

### During Reading

1. Read naturally (don't analyze while reading)
2. Mark reactions briefly (emoji, quick notes)
3. Track engagement levels
4. Note emotional responses
5. Flag confusion points

### After Reading

1. Capture immediate impressions
2. Review marked sections
3. Identify patterns
4. Complete [Reader Report](agent-framework/templates/reader-report-template.md)

## Key Principles (The Non-Negotiables)

### 1. Experience, Don't Fix
❌ "This scene should be cut"
✅ "I lost interest during this scene"

### 2. Specific, Not Vague
❌ "The pacing is off"
✅ "Chapters 8-11 felt slow; I found myself skimming"

### 3. Location, Location, Location
❌ "I was confused sometimes"
✅ "I was confused at Chapter 4, page 52 when Sarah suddenly appeared—wasn't she in Paris?"

### 4. Audience Lens
❌ Reading as yourself only
✅ Reading as the target audience would

## Quick Reaction Markers

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|

| 👍 or + | Like this / Good |
| 😐 or ~ | Neutral / Neither good nor bad |
| 😴 or - | Losing interest / Slow |
| ❓ or ? | Confused |
| 🤔 or ?? | Don't believe this / Implausible |

## Quick Assessment Framework

When evaluating a manuscript:

### Engagement
- Did I want to keep reading?
- Where did I want to stop?
- Where was I hooked?

### Emotion
- Did I feel anything?
- Did I care about the characters?
- Did emotional moments land?

### Clarity
- Was I ever confused?
- Did I always know what was happening?
- Could I follow the story?

### Satisfaction
- Did I get what I expected?
- Did the ending satisfy?
- Would I recommend this?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Editing while reading** - Just read; note reactions
2. **Prescribing solutions** - Describe problems, let others fix
3. **Forgetting target audience** - Read as intended reader
4. **Being vague** - Specific locations and effects
5. **Missing patterns** - One instance might be coincidence; five is a pattern

## Pro Tips

- **Read in realistic conditions** - Not when you're already bored/tired
- **Mark quickly** - Don't stop to analyze during first read
- **Trust first reactions** - Your initial response is often most accurate
- **Note what works too** - Writers need to know what to keep
- **Quantify when possible** - "Confused 3 times in Chapter 4" is more useful than "sometimes confused"

## Emergency Protocols

### Manuscript Is Very Rough
1. Focus on story-level issues
2. Don't get distracted by prose problems
3. Track engagement despite distractions
4. Report honestly but kindly
5. Note that prose issues may have affected response

### You're Not the Target Audience
1. Acknowledge this in your report
2. Try to imagine target reader reaction
3. Note where your reaction may differ from intended audience
4. Be clear about what's personal taste vs. universal issue
5. Still provide honest reaction

### Strong Negative Reaction
1. Step back before reporting
2. Identify specific causes
3. Distinguish taste from craft issues
4. Report honestly but constructively
5. Find positives to balance

## Report Quick Reference

Every reader report should include:

1. **Overall Impression** - Satisfaction, engagement level
2. **Engagement Map** - Where high/low across manuscript
3. **Confusion Points** - Specific locations and nature
4. **Emotional Response** - What you felt, when
5. **Genre Satisfaction** - Expectations met?
6. **Key Strengths** - What worked
7. **Key Concerns** - What didn't (with specifics)
8. **Target Audience Fit** - Would intended readers enjoy this?
