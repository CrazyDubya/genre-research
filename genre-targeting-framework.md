# Genre Targeting Framework

A practical framework to identify target genres and collect the right research inputs to build genre-specific story templates, constraints, and realism modules.

## 1. Identify Target Genres

Start with 3–7 target genres for a project. Typical anchors:

- Fantasy
- Romance
- Science Fiction
- Thriller
- Literary Fiction
- Mystery/Detective
- Horror
- Comedy
- Historical

**Selection criteria**
- **Reader promise:** What emotional payoff is the audience seeking?
- **Market comps:** Recent, successful titles in the same shelf/keyword space.
- **Tone + tropes:** Does the concept map cleanly to common genre tropes?
- **Length + structure norms:** Do the story’s scope and pacing fit the genre?

## 2. Research Packets Per Genre

For each target genre, collect the following data points. Capture in a repeatable template so you can compare across genres and spot mismatches early.

### 2.1 Tropes
- **Core tropes:** The minimum set that signals the genre.
- **Popular subgenre tropes:** What readers expect in common subgenres.
- **Avoidance list:** Tropes that readers in this genre dislike or consider lazy.

### 2.2 Narrative Beats
- **Opening beats:** Common first-act moves and hooks.
- **Midpoint beats:** Where the major shift or reversal typically lands.
- **Climax + resolution beats:** Required payoffs or reversals.
- **Genre-specific beats:** e.g., the “Dark Night” in romance or the “Revelation” in mysteries.

### 2.3 Pacing Norms
- **Average scene length and chapter rhythm.**
- **Action vs. reflection ratio.**
- **Escalation cadence:** How frequently stakes increase.
- **Expected time to “promise” delivery:** e.g., the meet-cute in romance, the first kill in a thriller.

### 2.4 Reader Expectations
- **Emotional promise:** The core feeling (hope, dread, wonder, catharsis).
- **Character archetypes:** Types readers expect to see.
- **Worldbuilding tolerance:** How much exposition is acceptable.
- **Moral logic:** Common ethical rules and boundary lines.

## 3. Genre-Specific Templates & Constraints

Build a reusable template and constraint checklist for each genre. These should be lightweight enough to use during outlining and draft evaluation.

### 3.1 Template Structure (Reusable)
Use this structure for each genre:

- **Genre promise statement:** One-sentence commitment to the reader.
- **Core tropes checklist:** Required, optional, forbidden.
- **Beat map:** 5–9 major beats with expected placement ranges.
- **Pacing envelope:** Scene types and pacing ratios.
- **Expectation guardrails:** Key do’s and don’ts.
- **Proof-of-fit signals:** What must be visible by the first 10–15%.

### 3.2 Constraints Examples

**Romance**
- **HEA/HFN required:** Happily Ever After or Happy For Now is mandatory.
- **Central love story:** The romance arc is the core spine.
- **Relationship progression:** Clear movement from tension → intimacy → commitment.

**Mystery/Detective**
- **Fair play clues:** Clues available to the reader before the reveal.
- **Satisfying solution:** A coherent explanation of method, motive, and opportunity.

**Thriller**
- **Escalating stakes:** Measurable stakes increases every 1–2 acts.
- **Time pressure:** A ticking clock or narrowing window.

**Fantasy**
- **World rules consistency:** Magic or world rules must hold under pressure.
- **Sense of wonder:** Recurrent moments that highlight the extraordinary.

**Science Fiction**
- **Speculative “what if” spine:** A central speculative idea with consequences.
- **Technical plausibility:** Internally consistent tech or science logic.

## 4. Topic-Specific Fact Research Modules

Create modular research packets to support realism when the genre depends on a domain (e.g., legal, medical, military, engineering). Each module can be attached to any genre template.

### 4.1 Module Structure
- **Domain overview:** What the domain does and how it works.
- **Key procedures:** Realistic steps, constraints, and timelines.
- **Institutional norms:** Roles, hierarchies, ethics, and protocols.
- **Vocabulary & jargon:** Accurate language and abbreviations.
- **Common inaccuracies:** Pitfalls to avoid.
- **Reality-based conflict hooks:** Where real-world friction occurs.

### 4.2 Example Modules

**Legal Drama Module**
- **Procedures:** Discovery, depositions, plea bargaining, trial sequence.
- **Timelines:** Case durations and delays.
- **Roles:** Judges, prosecutors, defense, clerks, investigators.
- **Constraints:** Evidence admissibility, professional ethics.

**Medical Drama Module**
- **Procedures:** Triage, diagnosis workflow, common interventions.
- **Timelines:** Realistic ER vs. specialist scheduling.
- **Roles:** Attending, resident, nurse, tech, admin.
- **Constraints:** HIPAA, consent, malpractice risks.

**Military Operations Module**
- **Procedures:** Command chain, mission briefings, rules of engagement.
- **Timelines:** Planning cycles, deployment cadence.
- **Roles:** Officer/enlisted responsibilities.
- **Constraints:** Logistics, comms limits, supply chains.

## 5. Implementation Checklist

- Choose 3–7 target genres and document why.
- Build a research packet for each genre (tropes, beats, pacing, expectations).
- Convert packets into genre templates and constraints.
- Add domain modules where realism is critical to credibility.
- Use the template during outlining and draft revision to confirm alignment.
