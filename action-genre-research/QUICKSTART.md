## What is Action?

**Core Formula:**
> **Stakes + Conflict + Movement = Action**

- **Stakes:** What will be lost? (Life, world, loved ones)
- **Conflict:** Who/what stands in the way? (Villain, obstacle, time)
- **Movement:** How is it resolved? (Fighting, chasing, escaping)

**Key Elements:**
- Physical confrontation
- High stakes (life/death, world-saving)
- Fast pacing
- Clear goals
- Escalating challenges
- Satisfying triumph

## 5-Minute Action Overview

**Hero:** Someone with skills (or gains them) who must act.

**Villain:** Someone threatening what hero values.

**Goal:** What hero wants (save someone, stop something, get something).

**Stakes:** What happens if hero fails (death, destruction, loss).

**Structure:**
1. **Setup:** Hero's world, threat emerges, hero commits
2. **Confrontation:** Hero faces escalating challenges, low point
3. **Resolution:** Hero triumphs through action

**Simple Example:**
- Hero: Father whose daughter is kidnapped
- Villain: Kidnappers demanding ransom
- Goal: Rescue daughter
- Stakes: Daughter's life
- Structure: Father pursues kidnappers, faces obstacles, defeats them, saves daughter

## The 4 Essential Action Questions

Before writing, answer these:

### 1. Who is your hero and what can they DO?
- Elite hero (trained, skilled) or everyman (ordinary, determined)?
- What are their skills? Combat, weapons, tactics, technology?
- What are their flaws? What makes them vulnerable?

### 2. What do they want and what stands in their way?
- **Goal:** Rescue someone, stop villain, escape, retrieve something
- **Obstacle:** Villain, army, nature, time, distance

### 3. What happens if they fail?
- **Personal stakes:** Someone hero loves dies
- **Global stakes:** World/city destroyed
- **Immediate:** Time running out (ticking clock)

### 4. Why do we care?
- Hero is relatable (ordinary person) or admirable (elite but vulnerable)
- Stakes are meaningful (not just "save the world" but "save daughter")
- Villain is threatening (could actually win)

## Action Archetypes (Choose Your Hero)

**Elite Hero:** Trained professional (soldier, spy, assassin)
- *Examples:* John Wick, Jason Bourne, Black Widow

**Everyman Hero:** Ordinary person forced into action
- *Examples:* John McClane (Die Hard), Dr. Grant (Jurassic Park)

**Reluctant Hero:** Has skills/past, wants nothing to do with action
- *Examples:* John Rambo, Logan/Wolverine

**Rising Hero:** Starts untrained, gains skills through story
- *Examples:* Neo (Matrix), Shang-Chi, Diana Prince

**Anti-Hero:** Morally gray hero fighting for good (or their version of it)
- *Examples:* Deadpool, The Punisher, Venom

## Action Structure in 3 Acts

### Act One: Setup (First 25%)
1. **Hero in normal world** - Show who they are
2. **Threat emerges** - Inciting incident
3. **Hero commits to goal** - "I'm going to stop them"
4. **First action sequence** - Sets tone

### Act Two: Confrontation (Middle 50%)
1. **Hero faces obstacles** - Tests and challenges
2. **Midpoint** - Stakes raise, hero wins but at cost
3. **All Is Lost** - Hero defeated, major loss
4. **Low Point** - Hero must find strength to continue

### Act Three: Resolution (Final 25%)
1. **Hero rallies** - Finds resolve
2. **Climax** - Biggest action sequence
3. **Victory** - Hero triumphs through action (not luck)
4. **Resolution** - World saved, hero changed

## Writing Action Scenes

### The Golden Rule

**CLARITY OVER CONFUSION**

Reader must understand:
- Where are characters?
- What are they doing?
- Who is hitting whom?
- What are the stakes?

### How to Write Action

**Do:**
- Use short, punchy sentences
- Use active verbs (slammed, fired, kicked, dove)
- Be specific (not "they fought")
- Show consequences (blood, injuries, damage)
- Reveal character through action

**Don't:**
- Use vague descriptions ("there was a battle")
- Make it confusing (who's doing what?)
- Forget geography (where are they?)
- Ignore consequences (nobody gets hurt)
- Use long speeches during combat

### Action Scene Example

**Weak:**
> "They fought intensely. Both men were skilled and determined."

**Strong:**
> "Miller struck first. A quick jab to the throat. Jacobs dodged, countered with a roundhouse. Miller blocked, swept Jacobs' leg. Jacobs hit the concrete hard, rolled, came up swinging. They traded blows—punch, kick, block, counter. Blood sprayed. Sweat dripped. Neither gave ground."

**Difference:** Specific actions, clear cause-and-effect, physical details.

---

## Set Pieces (Big Action Sequences)

A **set piece** is a large-scale, memorable action sequence.

### Set Piece Formula

1. **Setup** - Establish location, stakes, problem
2. **Engagement** - Hero enters conflict
3. **Escalation** - Gets harder/more dangerous
4. **Climax of Sequence** - Peak intensity
5. **Aftermath** - Consequences shown

### Set Piece Types

- **Chase:** Car, foot, aerial, water
- **Fight:** Hand-to-hand, armed, melee
- **Escape:** Prison, siege, building
- **Battle:** Small scale to war
- **Rescue:** Hostage, extraction, last-minute

### Set Piece Example: Car Chase

**Setup:** Villain kidnaps someone, speeds away. Hero pursues.

**Action:**
- Chase through city streets
- Villain's gunmen fire at hero
- Traffic, pedestrians as obstacles
- Police join chase (三方: hero, villain, cops)

**Escalation:**
- Chase enters construction zone
- Hero's car damaged
- Villain's car crashes
- Must rescue hostage before explosion

**Climax:** Hero pulls hostage from burning car. Explosion.

**Aftermath:** Hero injured, hostage safe, villain escaped or captured.

## Pacing in Action

### The Rhythm Rule

**Alternate Fast and Slow:**

**Fast (Action Sequences):**
- Physical conflict
- High stakes
- Short sentences
- Minimal dialogue
- Excitement

**Slow (Breathing Room):**
- Character development
- Plot setup
- Longer sentences
- More dialogue
- Tension building

**Why Both?**
- Constant action = fatigue (stops being exciting)
- Constant slow = boring (wrong genre)
- Alternation creates rhythm
- Slow moments make fast moments more impactful

**Pattern:**
```
Action (fast) → Breathing Room (slow) → Bigger Action (faster) → Shorter Breathing Room (slower) → Maximum Action (fastest) → Resolution (slow)
```

## Common Action Problems (Quick Fixes)

### Problem: "Confusing Action"
**Fix:** Simplify movements. Maintain clear geography. Use specific actions (not "they fought"). Show cause-and-effect clearly.

### Problem: "Low Stakes"
**Fix:** Make consequences devastating. Add time pressure. Protect someone hero loves. Make hero vulnerable (can get hurt).

### Problem: "Invincible Hero"
**Fix:** Hero must get hurt. Hero must lose battles. Hero must make mistakes. Villain must win sometimes. Victory must be earned.

### Problem: "Repetitive Action"
**Fix:** Each sequence must top previous. Vary environments. Vary opponents. Add unique elements. Escalate consistently.

### Problem: "Middle Drag"
**Fix:** Raise stakes. Add twist. Add unique set piece. Remove redundant scenes. Add character development.

## Action Subgenres (Choose One)

**Spy Thriller:** Espionage, gadgets, international intrigue (James Bond, Mission: Impossible)

**Martial Arts:** Combat, honor, training (The Karate Kid, Enter the Dragon)

**Superhero:** Powers, saving the world, responsibility (Spider-Man, The Avengers)

**Disaster:** Survival, nature as enemy (The Day After Tomorrow, Titanic)

**Buddy Cop:** Partnership, banter, contrasting styles (Lethal Weapon, Rush Hour)

**Heist:** Planning, teamwork, precision (Heat, Ocean's Eleven)

**War/Military:** Combat, brotherhood, sacrifice (Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down)

**Revenge:** Personal stakes, ruthless hero (John Wick, Taken)

## Next Steps

1. **Read full research files** for comprehensive understanding
2. **Study examples** in `examples/structure-examples.md`
3. **Use templates** for larger projects
4. **Analyze favorite action films/stories** - What works? Why?
5. **Write regularly** - Action is a skill, practice improves
6. **Test your action** - Read aloud, does it excite you?

---

## Remember

**Action is about:**
- **Spectacle** - Excitement and thrills
- **Character** - People we care about
- **Stakes** - Meaningful consequences
- **Escalation** - Each challenge tops previous
- **Triumph** - Earned victory through action

**Action is NOT:**
- Just explosions (needs character/story)
- Just fighting (needs emotional investment)
- Just spectacle (needs meaning)
- Just movement (needs purpose)

**The Golden Rule:**
**If it's not exciting, it's not action.** Test everything. If it doesn't thrill, fix it or cut it.

**Now go write something exciting!**
