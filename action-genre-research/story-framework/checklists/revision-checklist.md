## Quick Diagnostic Tests

### Problem: "Confusing Action"
**Check:** Is geography clear? Is action specific (not "they fought")?
**Fix:** Simplify movements, maintain spatial consistency, use clear cause-and-effect

### Problem: "Low Stakes"
**Check:** What happens if hero fails? Is it devastating? Immediate?
**Fix:** Make consequences severe, add time pressure, protect someone hero loves

### Problem: "Invincible Hero"
**Check:** Does hero get hurt? Lose battles? Make mistakes?
**Fix:** Add injuries, add failures, add struggles, make villain more threatening

### Problem: "Middle Drag"
**Check:** Do stakes raise? Is there escalation? Is there variety?
**Fix:** Raise stakes, add twist, add unique set piece, remove redundant scenes

### Problem: "Repetitive Action"
**Check:** Is each sequence unique? Does each top previous?
**Fix:** Add unique elements, vary environments, different opponents, creative obstacles
