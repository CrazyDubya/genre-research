## Key Principles of Slice of Life

### **1. Character Is Everything**

**Slice of life lives or dies on character.**

- Make characters **specific** (unique details, not generic)
- Make characters **complicated** (layers, contradictions)
- Make characters **vulnerable** (flaws, weaknesses)
- Make characters **human** (someone reader recognizes or wants to know)

### **2. Elevate the Mundane**

**Find meaning in ordinary moments.**

- Emotional stakes: Moments matter to character
- Universal resonance: Specific details evoke universal feelings
- Beauty: Language itself provides pleasure
- Subtext: Surface mundane, deeper meaning

### **3. Subtext Over Exposition**

**What's not said matters as much as what's said.**

- Characters talk about one thing, mean another
- Characters avoid saying what they feel
- Characters show truth through action

### **4. Atmosphere Is Structure**

**When there's no plot, atmosphere provides shape.**

- Sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste)
- Lighting, weather, season
- Pacing and rhythm
- Word choice and connotations

### **5. Emotional Resonance**

**Reader must feel something.**

- Recognition: "I've felt that"
- Empathy: "I can imagine that"
- Nostalgia: "I remember feeling that way"
- Insight: "I never thought of it that way"

---

## Common Slice of Life Problems

### **Problem: Nothing Happens**

**Solution:**
- Character must have internal shift
- Small but meaningful change
- Emotional processing
- Relationship evolution

### **Problem: Characters Are Boring**

**Solution:**
- Add specificity (unique details, quirks)
- Add contradictions (complicated people)
- Add voice (distinct speech patterns)
- Add vulnerability (flaws and fears)

### **Problem: Too Mundane**

**Solution:**
- Character fascination (make them interesting to watch)
- Emotional stakes (moments matter to character)
- Beautiful prose (language provides pleasure)
- Subtextual depth (surface mundane, deeper meaning)

### **Problem: Meandering**

**Solution:**
- Use structure (day, season, episodes)
- Thematic unity (all moments explore same question)
- Emotional arc (feelings shift from A to B)
- Closing resonance (ending feels complete)

## The Golden Rule

**Make the ordinary meaningful.**

Slice of life asks: What if we paid attention to the moments we usually ignore?

The coffee we make each morning. The commute we take. The conversations we have. The small joys and sorrows that make up most of our lives.

What if those moments matter? What if they're where life actually happens?

**Your job:** Make reader see the beauty, pain, and meaning in everyday experience.

**Write the ordinary beautifully.**
