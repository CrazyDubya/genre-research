# Dialogue and Voice in Slice of Life

## The Art of Subtext and Character Speech

**In slice of life, dialogue is often the primary action.**

When characters aren't fighting dragons or saving the world, they talk—they connect, avoid connection, reveal themselves, hide themselves, and create the texture of everyday life through conversation.

## The Central Role of Dialogue

### Why Dialogue Matters in Slice of Life

**In Plot-Driven Fiction:**
- Dialogue serves plot
- Characters say what they mean (usually)
- Information exchanged

**In Slice of Life:**
- Dialogue IS the story
- Characters rarely say exactly what they mean
- Subtext is primary

**Example:**

**Plot-Driven Dialogue:**
> "We have to defeat the villain," she said.
> "I agree," he said. "Let's go now."

**Slice of Life Dialogue:**
> "Nice weather we're having," she said, staring at her coffee.
> "It's raining," he said.
> "I like the rain."
> "Me too."
> Neither spoke. The rain drummed against the window.

**Difference:** Second dialogue isn't about weather. It's about two people who want to connect but don't know how, or maybe can't, or shouldn't. The surface conversation (weather) isn't the point—the subtext is.

### Dialogue Creates Character

**How Characters Speak Reveals Who They Are:**

**What They Talk About:**
- Interests, obsessions, fears
- **Example:** One character discusses philosophy; another discusses celebrity gossip

**How They Talk:**
- Vocabulary, sentence structure
- **Example:** Formal vs. casual, long explanations vs. short responses

**What They DON'T Say:**
- Avoidances, deflections
- **Example:** Character who deflects personal questions with humor

**Who They Talk To:**
- Different people bring out different sides
- **Example:** Character shy with strangers, loud with family

## Subtext: What's Not Said

### The Art of Unspoken Meaning

**Definition:** What is communicated beneath the surface dialogue.

**Why Subtext Matters:**
- More realistic (people rarely state feelings directly)
- More engaging (reader infers, participates)
- More powerful (showing, not telling)
- Deeper emotional resonance

### Types of Subtext

**1. Misdirection**
- Characters talk about one thing, mean another
- **Example:** Discussing a movie, actually discussing their failing relationship

**2. Avoidance**
- Characters avoid saying what they mean
- **Example:** "I'm fine" (not fine)

**3. Deflection**
- Characters deflect with humor, questions, tangents
- **Example:** Serious question met with joke

**4. Silence**
- What's not said speaks volumes
- **Example:** Awkward pause after loaded question

**5. Change of Subject**
- Conscious avoidance
- **Example:** "So, how's work?" (after near-confession)

**6. Talking Around**
- Approach subject indirectly
- **Example:** Hypothetical questions ("What if someone wanted to...")

### Creating Subtext

**Techniques:**

**1. Surface Conversation, Deeper Meaning**
- Characters discuss safe topic (weather, food)
- Actually discussing unsafe topic (relationship, feelings)
- **Example:**

> **Surface:** "This soup is good."
> **Subtext:** "I'm glad we're having dinner. I miss you. I want to say something but I'm scared."

**2. Action Over Dialogue**
- Character does, doesn't say
- **Example:** Character says "I'm not hungry" but keeps looking at food

**3. Physical Details**
- Objects, setting carry meaning
- **Example:** Character playing with ring (nervousness, thinking about relationship)

**4. Interior Monologue vs. Exterior Speech**
- Character thinks one thing, says another
- **Example:**

> **Interior:** I love you. Don't go. Stay with me forever.
> **Exterior:** "Drive safe."

**5. Contextual Meaning**
- Words mean different things in context
- **Example:** "We should talk" (I want to break up) vs. "We should talk" (I have good news)

**6. Incongruity**
- Words and tone don't match
- **Example:** "I'm so happy for you" (tone bitter)

### Subtext Examples

**Example 1: The Breakup That Isn't Happening**

> "Did you pay the electric bill?" she asked, not looking up from her phone.
>
> "Yeah. This morning."
>
> "Okay. Good."
>
> He waited. She kept scrolling.
>
> "Anything else?" he asked.
>
> "No. That's it."
>
> They'd been dancing around it for weeks. The conversation they needed to have but wouldn't.

**What's happening:**
- **Surface:** Paying bills
- **Subtext:** Relationship ending, neither will say it

**Example 2: Confession Avoided**

> "I saw Sarah today," he said.
>
> "Oh yeah?" She didn't look up from her book.
>
> "She asked about you."
>
> "That's nice."
>
> "Said she missed you."
>
> "Hmm."
>
> He waited. She turned a page.
>
> "I told her you were busy," he said.
>
> "Busy," she repeated.
>
> "Yeah. With work. And everything."
>
> "Right. Work."

**What's happening:**
- **Surface:** Conversation about Sarah
- **Subtext:** He wants to ask if she misses Sarah too (old flame), but won't

## Character Voice

### Distinct Voices for Distinct Characters

**The Challenge:** In slice of life, dialogue-heavy stories need character distinction, or reader can't tell who's speaking.

**The Test:** Remove dialogue tags. Can you still tell who's talking?

**Elements of Voice:**

**1. Vocabulary**
- Education level
- Profession (jargon)
- Interests (references)
- **Examples:**
  - **Academic:** "I fundamentally disagree with that premise"
  - **Casual:** "Yeah, no, that's dumb"

**2. Sentence Structure**
- Length and complexity
- **Examples:**
  - **Character A:** Short, fragmentary sentences. "Yeah. Sure. Whatever."
  - **Character B:** Long, rambling explanations. "Well, the thing is, when you really think about it, there are so many factors to consider..."

**3. Rhythm and Pace**
- Speed of speech
- Pauses, interruptions
- **Example:**
  - **Fast talker:** Words tumbling out, overlapping
  - **Slow talker:** Deliberate, thoughtful, pauses between words

**4. Catchphrases and Fillers**
- Repeated expressions
- **Examples:**
  - "Like," "you know," "literally" (younger)
  - "Frankly," "in my experience" (older)
  - "Honestly," "basically" (any age)

**5. Tone and Attitude**
- Cynical, optimistic, formal, casual
- **Example:**
  - **Cynical:** "Yeah, that'll work out great. Sure."
  - **Sincere:** "I really think we can do this!"

**6. What They Notice**
- Different characters notice different things
- **Example:**
  - **Artist:** Colors, light, composition
  - **Musician:** Sounds, rhythms
  - **Practical:** Costs, logistics, utility

### Creating Distinct Voices

**Step 1: Define Character's Speech Profile**
- Formal or casual?
- Fast or slow?
- What filler words?
- What sentence structure?

**Step 2: Write to That Profile**
- Stay consistent
- Adjust for mood (angry, sad, drunk)

**Step 3: Test**
- Remove dialogue tags
- Can you tell who's speaking?
- If not, strengthen distinctions

**Example: Same Character, Different Voices**

**Character 1 (Formal Academic):**
> "One must consider the broader implications of such a decision. The consequences could be quite severe."

**Character 2 (Casual Teenager):**
> "So like, if we do that, it's gonna be bad. Like, really bad."

**Character 3 (Cynical Older Person):**
> "Sure, go ahead. Don't listen to me. What do I know?"

**Each voice distinct, no dialogue tags needed.**

## Realistic Dialogue

### Making Dialogue Sound Authentic

**Bad Dialogue:**
- Characters explain things they both already know (for reader's benefit)
- Characters say exactly what they feel
- Characters speak in complete, formal sentences
- **Example:**

> "As you know, John, our mother died three years ago, leaving us with this house and a considerable inheritance, which has caused tension between us."

**Good Dialogue:**
- Characters talk like real people
- Incomplete sentences, interruptions, overlaps
- Characters talk past each other
- **Example:**

> "You still haven't sold the house?"
>
> "I'm getting to it."
>
> "It's been three years, Sarah."
>
> "I know how long it's been."

### Techniques for Realistic Dialogue

**1. Incomplete Sentences**
- People don't speak in complete thoughts
- **Example:** "I was going to— but then he— so I just left."

**2. Interruptions and Overlaps**
- Characters cut each other off
- **Example:**

> "I think we should—"
>
> "No, absolutely not."
>
> "But if you'd just—"
>
> "I said no."

**3. Non Sequiturs**
- Conversations veer off track
- **Example:**

> "So about the rent—"
>
> "Did you see that dog outside?"
>
> "The rent, Dave."
>
> "It looked just like Mr. Whiskers."

**4. Deflections**
- Characters avoid direct questions
- **Example:**

> "Are you seeing anyone?"
>
> "Work's been crazy. You know how it is."

**5. Repetition**
- People repeat when anxious or uncertain
- **Example:**

> "I don't know. I just... I don't know. I really don't know."

**6. Fillers and Pauses**
- "Um," "uh," "like" (in speech)
- Represented by ellipses, dashes in writing
- **Example:** "I was... well, I thought maybe..."

**7. Talking Past Each Other**
- Characters having different conversations
- **Example:**

> "I'm lonely," he said.
>
> "You should get out more," she said. "Join a club."
>
> "I don't want to join a club. I want—"
>
> "Exercise is good. You'd feel better."

## Dialogue as Action

### When There's No Physical Action, Dialogue Is Action

**In slice of life, conversation is the main event.**

**Dialogue Advances Story Through:**

**1. Revealing Character**
- How they speak shows who they are
- **Example:** Character who makes everything about themselves

**2. Evolving Relationships**
- Dynamic shifts through conversation
- **Example:** Two characters start as strangers, end as friends (or vice versa)

**3. Processing Emotions**
- Characters talk through feelings
- **Example:** Friends discuss heartbreak over many conversations

**4. Making Decisions**
- Characters decide through talking
- **Example:** Roommates arguing about chores leads to decision

**5. Creating Conflict**
- Tension, awkwardness, disagreement
- **Example:** Family dinner political argument

### Writing Dialogue Scenes

**Structure of Dialogue Scenes:**

**1. Opening**
- Characters enter situation
- Mood established

**2. Initial Exchange**
- Surface conversation
- Subtext begins

**3. Shift**
- Something changes (mood, topic, dynamic)
- Tension rises or falls

**4. Peak/Climax**
- Emotional high point
- Subtext nears surface

**5. Resolution**
- Conversation ends
- Dynamic changed (or confirmed)

**Example:**

> She knocked on his door. She'd rehearsed this a dozen times.
>
> He opened the door. "Oh. Hey."
>
> "Can we talk?"
>
> "Sure." He stepped back.
>
> They sat in his living room. The silence stretched.
>
> "How have you been?" she asked.
>
> "Fine. You?"
>
> "Fine."
>
> **[Initial exchange: surface, awkward]**
>
> "I saw your sister," she said. "She said you're seeing someone."
>
> "Yeah. It's... it's going well."
>
> **[Shift: subtext emerges]**
>
> "That's good," she said. "I'm glad."
>
> "Are you?"
>
> **[Peak: subtext surfaces]**
>
> She stood up. "I should go."
>
> "Yeah. Okay."
>
> **[Resolution: nothing resolved, dynamic confirmed]**

## Common Dialogue Problems

### Problem: On-the-Nose Dialogue

**Symptom:** Characters say exactly what they think and feel.

**Example:**
> "I am very sad about my mother's death," she cried. "I feel devastated and alone."

**Fix:**
- Show emotion through action
- Use subtext
- **Better:** She sat at the kitchen table, staring at her mother's empty chair. "I keep forgetting she's gone. Then I remember. Then I forget again."

### Problem: As You Know, Bob Dialogue

**Symptom:** Characters explain things they both already know.

**Example:**
> "As you know, John, we've been best friends for twenty years, ever since we met in college when you were dating my sister."

**Fix:**
- Trust reader to infer
- Reveal information naturally
- **Better:** "Twenty years," he said. "Can you believe it? Since college."

### Problem: All Characters Sound the Same

**Symptom:** Can't tell characters apart without dialogue tags.

**Fix:**
- Give each distinct voice
- Different vocabulary, rhythm, tone
- Test: Remove tags

### Problem: Too Much Dialogue

**Symptom:** Page after page of talking, nothing else.

**Fix:**
- Break up with action
- Add sensory details
- Use interior monologue
- Not every conversation needs to be fully written

### Problem: Unrealistic Speech

**Symptom:** Characters sound like written prose, not real speech.

**Fix:**
- Add interruptions, incomplete sentences
- Add fillers (in moderation)
- Make messier, more organic

### Problem: Dialogue Tags Show, Don't Tell

**Symptom:** Adverbs in tags ("she said angrily").

**Example:**
> "Get out!" she said angrily.

**Fix:**
- Let dialogue speak for itself
- Use action tags instead
- **Better:** "Get out!" She slammed her hand on the table.

## Interior Monologue

### Character's Inner Voice

**In slice of life, interior monologue is crucial.**

**Types:**

**1. Direct Thought**
- Character's thoughts in quotation marks
- **Example:** *I can't believe she just said that.*

**2. Indirect Thought**
- Filtered through narration
- **Example:** She couldn't believe she'd just said that.

**3. Stream of Consciousness**
- Continuous flow of thought
- **Example:** Virginia Woolf, James Joyce

**Using Interior Monologue:**
- Reveals what character won't say aloud
- Creates subtext (thought vs. speech)
- Deepens reader understanding

**Example:**

> "I'm happy for you," she said.
>
> *Liar,* she thought. *You're not happy. You're bitter and lonely and you hate yourself for it.*
