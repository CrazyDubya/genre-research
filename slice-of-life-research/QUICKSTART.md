- **Emotional Resonance:** Impact through recognition and empathy
- **Subtext:** What's unsaid as important as what's said
- **Atmosphere:** Mood and tone central to experience

**What Slice of Life Is NOT:**
- Not plot-driven or action-heavy
- Not focused on dramatic conflicts
- Not about extraordinary events (usually)
- Not simply "boring" or "nothing happens"

## The 5-Minute Slice of Life

### Quick Concept

**Your Story In One Sentence:**
> [Character] spends [time period] [doing everyday activity], and through [specific moments], discovers [emotional truth].

**Example:**
> A lonely office worker spends her lunch break in the park, and through watching couples and families, discovers she's not ready to date again but is ready to reach out to old friends.

---

## Step 1: Choose Your Focus

### What Everyday Experience?

**Choose:**
- **Character:** Who are they?
- **Timeframe:** Day, week, season?
- **Setting:** Where does this happen?
- **Mood:** What emotional tone?

**Example:**
- **Character:** Divorced father, 45
- **Timeframe:** One Sunday
- **Setting:** His apartment, then park with kids
- **Mood:** Melancholic but hopeful

### Subgenre (Optional)

**Common Types:**
- **Contemporary:** Modern everyday life
- **YA/Coming-of-Age:** Teen experiences
- **Workplace:** Job and colleagues
- **Family:** Domestic dynamics
- **Historical:** Past time periods
- **Iyashikei:** Gentle, healing stories

**Choose what fits your concept.**

## Step 2: Create Your Character

### Make Them Specific (Not Generic)

**Generic:** "Nice guy, lonely"

**Specific:**
- Keeps detailed spreadsheet of every book he's read since age 12
- Talks to his plants (they're better listeners than people)
- Has ex-wife's number in phone but never calls
- Watches couples in parks, then feels ashamed

**Give Them:**
1. **Flaws:** Socially anxious, stubborn, oblivious
2. **Strengths:** Loyal, observant, kind
3. **Contradictions:** Loves people but fears them; wants connection but sabotages it
4. **Voice:** How do they speak/think?

### What Do They Want?

**Conscious Desire:**
> "I want to be left alone" (but actually doesn't)

**Deeper Need:**
> "I want to feel less lonely"

---

## Step 3: Choose Your Structure

### How Will You Organize This?

**Options:**

**Day-in-the-Life:** Single day from waking to sleeping
- **Best for:** Intimate character studies
- **Example:** Character's rainy Sunday

**Episodic:** Series of vignettes
- **Best for:** Variety, ensemble casts
- **Example:** Coffee shop observations across week

**Seasonal:** Spring through winter
- **Best for:** Progression, cycles
- **Example:** Character's first year after divorce

**Linear:** Time passes (week, month, year)
- **Best for:** Showing change
- **Example:** Character builds confidence over summer

**Choose structure that fits your timeframe and character.**

## Step 4: Plan Key Moments

### 5-7 Important Scenes

**For Each Scene, Note:**
1. **What happens** (surface action)
2. **What it means** (subtext/emotion)
3. **Sensory detail** (sight, sound, smell, etc.)

**Example Plan:**

**Scene 1: Morning Routine**
- **Action:** Wakes up, makes coffee, stares out window
- **Meaning:** Loneliness, ritual, comfort in routine
- **Detail:** Cold coffee cup, gray sky

**Scene 2: Phone Call**
- **Action:** Calls daughter, gets voicemail
- **Meaning:** Distance, failed connection
- **Detail:** Her recorded voice, then beep

**Scene 3: Park Visit**
- **Action:** Takes kids to park, watches them play
- **Meaning:** Bittersweet joy, guilt, love
- **Detail:** Laughter, cold bench

**Scene 4: Grocery Store**
- **Action:** Shops for dinner, runs into neighbor
- **Meaning:** Social anxiety, missed connection
- **Detail:** Fluorescent lights, awkward conversation

**Scene 5: Evening**
- **Action:** Kids leave, alone in apartment
- **Meaning:** Return to loneliness but with memory of joy
- **Detail:** Quiet apartment, fading light

**Scene 6: Small Action**
- **Action:** Sends text to old friend
- **Meaning:** Hope, reaching out
- **Detail:** Phone light, waiting for response

**Scene 7: Sleep**
- **Action:** Goes to bed, day ends
- **Meaning:** Acceptance, small step taken
- **Detail:** Dark room, possibility

---

## Step 5: Create Atmosphere

### Sensory Details Create Mood

**For Your Dominant Mood, List:**

**Sight:**
> Gray sky, fluorescent lights, fading light, phone glow

**Sound:**
> Rain on window, refrigerator hum, children's laughter, silence

**Smell:**
> Old coffee, rain, plastic seats, fabric softener

**Touch:**
> Cold coffee cup, hard park bench, warm blanket

**Taste:**
> Bitter coffee, metallic anxiety, sweet memory

**Use these details to immerse reader.**

### Lighting, Weather, Season

**Lighting:**
> Morning: Gray, diffuse light
> Afternoon: Harsh fluorescent
> Evening: Warm lamp, fading to dark

**Weather:**
> Rain all day (melancholy, but also cleansing)

**Season:**
> Fall (change, loss, nostalgia)

---

## Step 6: Write Dialogue with Subtext

### What Characters Say vs. What They Mean

**Surface Conversation:**
> "Nice weather we're having."
> "It's raining."
> "I like the rain."
> "Me too."

**Subtext:**
> Both are lonely, want to connect, don't know how.

**Rule of Thumb:**
- Characters rarely say exactly what they feel
- What they avoid saying reveals what matters
- Surface conversation = deeper meaning

### Make Each Voice Distinct

**Character A (Formal, anxious):**
> "One must consider the broader implications."

**Character B (Casual, relaxed):**
> "Yeah, whatever works."

**Test:** Remove dialogue tags—can you still tell who's speaking?

---

## Step 7: Find the Emotional Arc

### Even Without Plot, There's Movement

**Opening Emotion:** Lonely, isolated

**Shift:** Connection with kids (joy + guilt)

**Closing Emotion:** Still lonely, but took small step (texted friend)

**The Arc:**
> From total isolation → glimpse of connection → small hope

**Key:** Character didn't dramatically change, but perspective shifted.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Nothing Happens

**Wrong:** Character sits alone, nothing changes, boring.

**Right:** Character sits alone, observes, processes emotions, takes small action.

### Mistake 2: Characters Are Boring

**Wrong:** Generic "nice guy"

**Right:** Specific details, contradictions, vulnerabilities

### Mistake 3: On-the-Nose Dialogue

**Wrong:** "I am sad and lonely," she said.

**Right:** She sat alone on the park bench, watching couples hold hands.

### Mistake 4: No Atmosphere

**Wrong:** Generic setting, no sensory details.

**Right:** Specific details that create mood.

## Essential Slice of Life Principles

### 1. Character Is Everything

**Without compelling characters, slice of life fails.**

Make characters:
- **Specific:** Unique details, not generic traits
- **Complicated:** Layers and contradictions
- **Vulnerable:** Flaws and weaknesses
- **Human:** Someone reader recognizes or wants to know

### 2. Elevate the Mundane

**Find meaning in ordinary moments.**

Techniques:
- **Emotional stakes:** Make moments matter to character
- **Universal resonance:** Specific details evoke universal feelings
- **Beauty:** Language itself provides pleasure
- **Subtext:** Surface mundane, deeper meaning

### 3. Subtext Over Exposition

**What's not said matters as much as what's said.**

Characters:
- Talk about one thing, mean another
- Avoid saying what they feel
- Show truth through action, not words

### 4. Atmosphere Is Structure

**When there's no plot, atmosphere provides shape.**

Elements:
- Sensory details
- Lighting, weather, season
- Pacing and rhythm
- Word choice and connotations

### 5. Emotional Resonance

**Reader must feel something.**

Types of resonance:
- **Recognition:** "I've felt that"
- **Empathy:** "I can imagine that"
- **Nostalgia:** "I remember feeling that way"
- **Insight:** "I never thought of it that way"

## The Golden Rule

**Make the ordinary meaningful.**

Slice of life asks: What if we paid attention to the moments we usually ignore?

What if the coffee we make each morning, the commute we take, the conversations we have—what if they mattered?

What if the mundane is where life actually happens?

**Your job:** Make reader see the beauty, pain, and meaning in everyday experience.

**Write the ordinary beautifully.**
