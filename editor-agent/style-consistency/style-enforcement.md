# Style Enforcement

Style consistency ensures the manuscript maintains coherent voice, tone, and stylistic choices throughout. This guide covers identifying, documenting, and enforcing style across a manuscript.

## What Style Enforcement Covers

### Voice Consistency

The authorial voice should:
- Remain recognizable throughout
- Match genre expectations
- Serve the story appropriately
- Feel intentional and controlled

### Tone Consistency

The emotional tone should:
- Match scene content
- Shift appropriately between scenes
- Maintain overall consistency
- Support genre expectations

### Style Guide Adherence

Technical style should:
- Follow established guides consistently
- Document project-specific choices
- Apply uniformly throughout
- Create professional presentation

## Voice Elements

### Identifying Voice

Voice is composed of:

**Sentence patterns:**
- Average sentence length
- Simple vs. complex sentence preference
- Rhythm and flow characteristics
- Opening patterns

**Vocabulary:**
- Formality level
- Technical language use
- Distinctive word choices
- Metaphor and imagery style

**Narrative distance:**
- Close (intimate, in-character)
- Middle (guided but distinct)
- Far (observational, detached)

**Tonal qualities:**
- Serious/humorous ratio
- Emotional register
- Irony and wit
- Warmth or coolness

### Voice Calibration

Before editing, establish voice baseline:

```
VOICE PROFILE: [Project Title]

SENTENCE PATTERNS:
- Typical length: [Short/Medium/Long]
- Complexity: [Simple/Varied/Complex]
- Distinctive patterns: [Note any]

VOCABULARY:
- Register: [Formal/Casual/Mixed]
- Notable preferences: [Specific words/phrases used]
- Avoidances: [What author doesn't use]

NARRATIVE APPROACH:
- Distance: [Close/Middle/Far]
- POV handling: [Notes]
- Characteristic techniques: [Note any]

TONE:
- Overall: [Description]
- Genre alignment: [How it matches/differs]

SAMPLE PASSAGES:
- Ch. [X], p. [Y]: "[Quote showing characteristic voice]"
- Ch. [X], p. [Y]: "[Another representative sample]"
```

### Voice Drift Detection

Signs of voice drift:
- Sentence patterns suddenly change
- Vocabulary shifts notably
- Tone changes without story reason
- Different "feel" to sections

Common causes:
- Writing across long periods
- Different moods/states during writing
- Attempting to "improve" style mid-project
- Influence from current reading

### Voice Correction

When voice drifts:

1. **Identify the drift**
   - What specifically changed?
   - When did it start?
   - Is it progressive or sudden?

2. **Determine the "true" voice**
   - What establishes the baseline?
   - What serves the story best?
   - What is most sustainable?

3. **Mark inconsistencies**
   - Note passages that deviate
   - Explain the deviation
   - Suggest calibration to baseline

4. **Preserve intentional variation**
   - Scene demands may require shifts
   - Character POV may vary
   - Emotional moments may differ

## Tone Management

### Tone Types

| Tone | Characteristics |
|------|-----------------|
| Light | Upbeat, humorous, low stakes feeling |
| Dark | Serious, heavy, high emotional weight |
| Suspenseful | Tense, uncertain, threat-aware |
| Romantic | Warm, emotionally focused, relationship-centered |
| Ironic | Detached, knowing, subtext-rich |
| Earnest | Sincere, emotionally direct, unironic |

### Appropriate Tone Shifts

Tone should shift when:
- Scene content demands it
- Character emotion changes
- Story phase changes
- Reader experience needs it

Shifts should:
- Be deliberate
- Transition smoothly
- Serve story purpose
- Return appropriately

### Tone Problems

**Tonal whiplash:**
- Abrupt shift without transition
- Reader disorientation
- Undermines emotional investment
**Fix:** Add transitional content; smooth the shift

**Tonal inconsistency:**
- Same type of scene varies in tone
- No clear reason for differences
- Feels uncontrolled
**Fix:** Establish baseline; calibrate deviations

**Tonal mismatch:**
- Tone doesn't serve content
- Comedy in tragedy (unless intentional)
- Lightness in serious moments
**Fix:** Align tone to story needs

## Style Sheet Creation

### Core Components

```
STYLE SHEET: [Project Title]

GENERAL PREFERENCES:
- Serial comma: [Yes/No]
- Singular they: [Yes/No]
- Numbers: [Spell out through ___]
- Time format: [Style]
- Date format: [Style]

PUNCTUATION:
- Dialogue attribution: [Style]
- Em dash spacing: [Style]
- Ellipsis format: [Style]

CAPITALIZATION:
- [List project-specific decisions]

ITALICS USED FOR:
- [List applications]

CHARACTER NAMES:
- [Full name]: [Nickname(s)], [Title if any]
- [Continue for all named characters]

PLACE NAMES:
- [Location]: [Spelling/capitalization]
- [Continue for all named places]

SPECIALIZED TERMS:
- [Term]: [Spelling/capitalization/definition]
- [Continue for all]

STYLE DECISIONS:
- [Issue]: [Decision made]
- [Continue as needed]
```

### Documenting Decisions

For each style decision, record:
- What the issue was
- What was decided
- Why (if helpful)
- Where first applied (chapter reference)

### Applying Consistently

**First occurrence:** Make decision, document
**Subsequent occurrences:** Apply documented decision
**Conflicts:** Resolve in favor of consistency
**Exceptions:** Document and justify

## Genre-Specific Style

### Genre Expectations

Each genre has style conventions:

**Literary fiction:**
- More complex prose acceptable
- Voice experimentation welcomed
- Slower pacing standard
- Subtext valued

**Commercial fiction:**
- Accessible prose preferred
- Clear storytelling prioritized
- Pacing expectations genre-specific
- Direct engagement valued

**Genre fiction (romance, thriller, etc.):**
- Genre conventions expected
- Pacing norms established
- Reader expectations specific
- Tropes and style often linked

### Balancing Voice and Genre

The author's voice must work within genre context:

**Questions to ask:**
- Does this voice serve this genre's readers?
- Does it meet reader expectations while being distinctive?
- Are deviations from convention intentional and effective?
- Does style enhance or hinder genre experience?

## POV Style Consistency

### Single POV

Maintain consistency in:
- Narrative voice throughout
- Access to thoughts/feelings
- Information available
- Language appropriate to character

### Multiple POV

Each POV should:
- Be distinguishable
- Maintain its own consistency
- Not bleed into other POVs
- Have documented voice profile

**Common problems:**
- POVs sound too similar
- POV-inappropriate knowledge
- Narrative voice overriding character voice
- Inconsistent access to interiority

## Style Enforcement Process

### Setup

1. Read full manuscript for voice
2. Create voice profile
3. Establish style sheet
4. Note genre expectations

### During Editing

1. Flag voice deviations
2. Note tone inconsistencies
3. Apply style sheet consistently
4. Update style sheet as needed
5. Track patterns for global notes

### Reporting

Include in feedback:
- Voice assessment
- Tone observations
- Style sheet
- Consistency issues found
- Recommendations

## Style Queries

### Framing Style Feedback

**For voice issues:**
"This passage feels different from the established voice. The sentence structure is more complex, and the vocabulary more formal than elsewhere. Consider whether this shift is intentional—if so, the transition could be smoother. If not, consider revising toward the lighter, more direct voice established earlier."

**For tone issues:**
"The humor in this scene undercuts the emotional weight of the previous chapter. If the tonal shift is intentional (perhaps the character uses humor to deflect), consider adding a beat that acknowledges this. If the light tone wasn't intentional, the scene might benefit from more emotional weight."

**For style inconsistencies:**
"Note: 'grey' is used here, but 'gray' appears elsewhere. Please confirm which spelling to use throughout; I'll apply consistently."
