# Editing Philosophy

The foundational approach to editorial work. This guide establishes the mindset, responsibilities, and ethical framework for effective editing.

## The Editor's Role

### What an Editor Is

An editor is:
- **A story advocate** - Fighting for the narrative's success
- **A reader proxy** - Experiencing the work as audiences will
- **A craft advisor** - Bringing expertise to serve the work
- **A voice protector** - Preserving what makes this story unique
- **A quality guardian** - Ensuring standards are met

### What an Editor Is Not

An editor is not:
- A co-author (unless specifically that arrangement)
- A style imposer
- A personal preference enforcer
- A creativity suppressant
- A final authority on artistic choices

## Core Values

### 1. Story Service

Every editorial decision should serve the story:

**Ask before every change:**
- Does this make the story stronger?
- Does this serve the reader?
- Does this preserve authorial intent?
- Is this change necessary?

**The hierarchy of concerns:**
1. Does the story work? (Plot, character, structure)
2. Does the story flow? (Pacing, transitions, rhythm)
3. Does the story communicate? (Clarity, precision)
4. Does the story polish? (Grammar, format, consistency)

### 2. Voice Preservation

The author's voice is sacred:

**Understanding voice:**
- Sentence rhythm and structure patterns
- Word choice preferences
- Tonal qualities
- Narrative perspective characteristics
- Stylistic signatures

**Protecting voice:**
- Identify voice elements before editing
- Question changes that alter voice
- Suggest within established patterns
- Return to original when recalibrating
- Distinguish "error" from "style"

**Voice vs. Error:**
| Voice | Error |
|-------|-------|
| Intentional fragments | Accidental incomplete sentences |
| Unique syntax patterns | Confusing constructions |
| Regional/character dialect | Inconsistent dialect |
| Stylistic punctuation | Incorrect punctuation |
| Deliberate rule-breaking | Unknowing rule-breaking |

### 3. Constructive Partnership

Editing is collaboration, not correction:

**The partnership mindset:**
- Writer and editor share the goal of a great book
- Editor brings expertise; writer brings vision
- Both perspectives are valuable
- Disagreement is productive when respectful
- Final authority rests with the writer

**Constructive practices:**
- Lead with what works
- Explain the "why" behind concerns
- Offer solutions, not just problems
- Acknowledge the difficulty of revision
- Celebrate improvements

### 4. Progressive Refinement

Edit in the right order:

```
WRONG: Polish prose → Fix plot holes → Restructure
RIGHT: Restructure → Fix plot holes → Polish prose
```

**Why order matters:**
- Developmental changes may cut polished content
- Line editing assumes structure is final
- Copyediting assumes prose is final
- Each pass builds on the previous
- Efficiency requires proper sequencing

### 5. Transparent Reasoning

Never edit without explanation:

**Every significant note should include:**
- What the issue is
- Why it's a problem
- What the impact is
- What the solution might be (when helpful)

**Example of poor feedback:**
"This doesn't work."

**Example of good feedback:**
"This revelation comes too early—by showing the antagonist's motivation in Chapter 3, we lose the mystery that should sustain reader interest through the midpoint. Consider revealing this information after the protagonist's discovery in Chapter 12."

## The Editorial Mindset

### Reading as an Editor

**First read (Developmental):**
- Read as a reader first
- Note emotional responses
- Track engagement/confusion
- Consider overall effectiveness
- Don't mark yet (or mark minimally)

**Second read (Structural):**
- Analyze structure against genre expectations
- Verify plot logic
- Assess character arcs
- Evaluate pacing
- Take comprehensive notes

**Third read (Line level):**
- Focus on prose quality
- Consider sentence-level flow
- Evaluate word choices
- Note patterns and repetitions
- Mark specific suggestions

**Fourth read (Technical):**
- Verify grammar and punctuation
- Check spelling and usage
- Ensure consistency
- Verify formatting
- Final detail check

### Managing Editorial Bias

**Recognize your preferences:**
- What styles do you personally prefer?
- What genres influence your expectations?
- What "rules" do you believe in?
- What irritates you (perhaps unnecessarily)?

**Separate preference from problem:**
- "I don't like this" ≠ "This is wrong"
- "I would write it differently" ≠ "This needs to change"
- "This breaks a 'rule'" ≠ "This doesn't work"

**Ask clarifying questions:**
- Is this actually an error or a choice?
- Would readers have a problem, or just me?
- Does this serve the story's goals?
- Is this consistent with the work's style?

### Handling Difficult Edits

**When you see a major problem:**
1. Verify it's actually a problem (not preference)
2. Assess the scope and impact
3. Consider the revision difficulty
4. Frame feedback constructively
5. Offer to discuss if complex

**When changes are extensive:**
- Prioritize ruthlessly
- Group related issues
- Indicate what's critical vs. suggested
- Acknowledge the scope
- Offer support for the revision process

**When you disagree with the writer:**
- Re-examine your position
- Explain your reasoning clearly
- Accept the writer's final decision
- Document for consistency
- Move forward without resentment

## Ethical Editing

### Editorial Integrity

**Do:**
- Apply consistent standards
- Treat all manuscripts fairly
- Acknowledge limitations
- Admit uncertainty
- Prioritize the work's success

**Don't:**
- Let personal feelings affect quality
- Apply double standards
- Claim expertise you lack
- Pretend certainty where none exists
- Prioritize speed over quality

### Writer Respect

**Honor the writer's:**
- Creative vision
- Final authority
- Emotional investment
- Development process
- Individual voice

**Even when:**
- You disagree
- Changes seem necessary
- Progress is slow
- Choices confuse you
- You know you're right

### Honest Assessment

**Be truthful about:**
- Manuscript readiness
- Scope of issues
- Timeline realities
- Quality level
- Your confidence in judgments

**Frame honestly but kindly:**
- Don't sugarcoat problems
- Don't catastrophize issues
- Don't make false promises
- Don't assign blame
- Do offer hope and paths forward
