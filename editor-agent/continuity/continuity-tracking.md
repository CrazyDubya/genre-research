# Continuity Tracking

Continuity management ensures internal consistency throughout a manuscript. This guide covers systematic approaches to tracking and verifying story details across characters, setting, timeline, and world rules.

## Why Continuity Matters

### Reader Impact

Continuity breaks:
- Pull readers out of the story
- Undermine narrative trust
- Signal carelessness
- Create confusion
- Damage immersion

### Common Continuity Failures

- Character eye color changes
- Timeline impossibilities
- Characters knowing things they shouldn't
- Forgotten injuries or conditions
- Setting details that shift
- World rules that contradict

## Character Continuity

### Physical Description Tracking

Create character cards tracking:

```
CHARACTER: [Name]
Chapter Introduced: [X]

PHYSICAL DETAILS:
- Hair color/style:
- Eye color:
- Height/build:
- Distinguishing features:
- Age:
- Typical clothing:

Notes: [Source chapters for each detail]
```

### Character Knowledge Tracking

Track what each character knows:

| Event/Information | Characters Who Know | Chapter Learned | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------|
| The murder weapon location | Detective Jones | Ch. 4 | Found at scene |
| The victim's affair | Maria, the husband | Ch. 7, Ch. 2 | Maria: witnessed; Husband: revealed Ch. 12 |

### Character Arc Tracking

Monitor development progression:

```
CHARACTER: [Name]

ARC: [Brief description]

PROGRESSION:
- Ch. 1-3: [Starting state]
- Ch. 4-8: [Early development]
- Ch. 9-15: [Middle development]
- Ch. 16-20: [Late development]
- Ch. 21+: [Resolution]

KEY MOMENTS:
- Ch. [X]: [Turning point]
- Ch. [Y]: [Critical decision]
```

### Relationship Tracking

Document relationship states:

| Relationship | Starting State | Key Changes | Ending State |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Alex & Jordan | Strangers | Ch. 3: meet; Ch. 8: conflict; Ch. 15: reconcile | Close friends |
| Sarah & Mom | Estranged | Ch. 10: confrontation; Ch. 18: breakthrough | Rebuilding |

## Timeline Continuity

### Creating a Story Timeline

Document every time marker:

```
TIMELINE: [Story Title]

DAY 1 (Ch. 1-2)
- Morning: [Events]
- Afternoon: [Events]
- Evening: [Events]

DAY 2 (Ch. 3-4)
- Morning: [Events]
[...]

SPECIAL MARKERS:
- "Three weeks later" - Ch. 8 (now Day 22)
- "Last summer" flashback - Ch. 11
```

### Timeline Verification Points

Check for:
- **Travel time:** Can characters get from A to B in stated time?
- **Event sequence:** Do causes precede effects?
- **Character availability:** Is the character where they need to be?
- **Healing/growth:** Appropriate time for injuries to heal, relationships to develop?
- **External markers:** Seasons, holidays, ages match timeline?

### Time Marker Consistency

Track how time passes:

| Reference | Chapter | Absolute Time | Notes |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| "Monday morning" | 1 | Day 1 | Story start |
| "That evening" | 2 | Day 1 | Same day |
| "Two days later" | 3 | Day 3 | Verify nothing missed |
| "The following week" | 5 | Day 10 | Check against events |

## Setting Continuity

### Location Mapping

For each significant location:

```
LOCATION: [Name]

DESCRIPTION (Ch. X):
- Layout:
- Key features:
- Sensory details:

SUBSEQUENT MENTIONS:
- Ch. Y: [Additional details]
- Ch. Z: [Changes]

CONSISTENCY NOTES:
- [Any issues or clarifications]
```

### Geographic Verification

Check:
- Distance between locations
- Travel methods and times
- Physical possibilities (can you see X from Y?)
- Weather/climate appropriateness for location
- Real-world accuracy (if real places)

### Setting Detail Tracking

| Location | Detail | Chapter | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| The cottage | Blue door | 3 | Established |
| The cottage | Red door | 12 | INCONSISTENCY |
| Main Street | Runs east-west | 5 | Established |
| Main Street | "Heading north" | 8 | Verify against Ch. 5 |

## World Rules Continuity

### Magic/System Rules

If your story has special rules (magic, technology, etc.):

```
RULE: [Description]
Established: Ch. [X]

APPLICATIONS:
- Ch. Y: [How it's used]
- Ch. Z: [How it's used]

LIMITATIONS:
- [What it can't do]
- [Costs/requirements]

CONSISTENCY CHECKS:
- Ch. W: [Does it follow the rules?]
```

### Social/Cultural Rules

For constructed or specific societies:

```
RULE: [Description]
Context: [When/where this applies]

DEMONSTRATIONS:
- Ch. X: [Example in text]
- Ch. Y: [Example in text]

EXCEPTIONS:
- [Any acknowledged exceptions]

VIOLATIONS TO CHECK:
- Ch. Z: [Possible rule break?]
```

## The Continuity Pass

### When to Do It

- After developmental and line editing
- During copyediting (integrated or separate)
- Any time significant revisions occur
- Before final proofread

### Continuity Pass Process

**Phase 1: Information Gathering**
1. Create character cards
2. Build timeline
3. Map settings
4. Document world rules
5. Note key facts/details

**Phase 2: Verification**
1. Check each character detail against cards
2. Verify timeline logic
3. Cross-reference setting details
4. Test world rule applications
5. Flag all inconsistencies

**Phase 3: Resolution**
1. Categorize inconsistencies by type
2. Determine correct version for each
3. Mark necessary changes
4. Query author on ambiguous items
5. Document resolutions

### Priority Ranking

| Priority | Type | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| Critical | Plot-breaking inconsistencies | Must fix |
| High | Character knowledge errors | Should fix |
| Medium | Physical description changes | Should fix |
| Low | Minor detail variations | Consider fixing |
| Query | Unclear which is correct | Ask author |

## Common Continuity Traps

### The Revised Chapter Problem

When chapters are revised:
- Old details may no longer apply
- References to cut scenes remain
- New details contradict established ones
- Timeline shifts aren't propagated

**Solution:** After significant revisions, re-verify affected details against tracking documents.

### The Series Problem

In series:
- Character details evolve between books
- Backstory may contradict earlier books
- Timeline across books must track
- Readers remember (even if writer doesn't)

**Solution:** Maintain series bible with canon details; verify against all previous books.

### The Multiple POV Problem

With multiple viewpoint characters:
- Same event may be described differently
- Character knowledge must stay appropriate
- Timeline must work for all POVs
- Physical details must match across POVs

**Solution:** Track events from each POV; verify no POV has inappropriate information.

## Tracking Tools

### Spreadsheet Approach

Create sheets for:
- Characters (physical details, knowledge states)
- Timeline (day-by-day events)
- Settings (location details)
- World rules (systems and their applications)
- Issues log (inconsistencies found)

### Card/Note Approach

Physical or digital cards for:
- Each character
- Each location
- Each world rule
- Running timeline

### Story Bible Approach

Single document containing:
- All character information
- World-building details
- Timeline
- Map/geography
- Style decisions

## Continuity Query Format

When flagging issues:

```
CONTINUITY QUERY

Location: Chapter [X], page [Y]
Issue: [Description of inconsistency]
Conflicting reference: Chapter [A], page [B]

Details:
- Ch. [X]: "[Quote showing one version]"
- Ch. [A]: "[Quote showing different version]"

Suggested resolution: [If you have a preference]
Author decision needed: [Yes/No]
```
