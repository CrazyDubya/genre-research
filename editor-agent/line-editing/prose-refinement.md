# Prose Refinement

Line editing addresses the sentence and paragraph level of a manuscript: flow, clarity, word choice, and rhythm. This guide covers techniques for refining prose while preserving authorial voice.

## Line Editing Scope

### What Line Editing Addresses

- Sentence clarity and flow
- Word choice precision
- Paragraph construction
- Rhythm and pacing (micro-level)
- Transitions between ideas
- Dialogue effectiveness
- Description quality

### What Line Editing Assumes

- Developmental issues are resolved
- Structure is finalized
- Content is staying
- It's worth polishing this prose

### What Line Editing Leaves for Later

- Grammar and punctuation (copyediting)
- Spelling (copyediting)
- Consistency details (copyediting)
- Formatting (copyediting/proofing)

## Sentence-Level Work

### Clarity

**Goal:** Reader understands on first read

**Common clarity issues:**
- Ambiguous pronoun references
- Unclear subject-verb relationships
- Tangled syntax
- Missing context
- Assumed knowledge

**Clarity test:** Read the sentence once. Did you immediately understand the meaning?

**Example fix:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| She told her that she would handle it. | Maria told Susan that Susan would handle it. |
| When the storm passed by the house, it collapsed. | The storm collapsed the house as it passed. |

### Concision

**Goal:** Every word earns its place

**Targets for trimming:**
- Redundancies ("past history," "advance planning")
- Filler phrases ("in order to," "the fact that")
- Unnecessary modifiers
- Throat-clearing openings
- Echoes (unintentional repetition)

**The concision test:** If removing a word changes nothing, remove it.

**Example fix:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| She was completely and utterly exhausted. | She was exhausted. |
| In order to get to the store | To get to the store |
| He thought to himself | He thought |

### Sentence Variety

**Goal:** Rhythm serves content

**Vary:**
- Sentence length (mix short, medium, long)
- Sentence structure (simple, compound, complex)
- Sentence openings (not all Subject-Verb)
- Rhythm patterns (prevent monotony)

**Pattern for impact:**
- Action sequences: Shorter sentences, faster rhythm
- Emotional moments: Varied rhythm, strategic pauses
- Description: Longer sentences, flowing rhythm
- Emphasis: Short sentence stands alone.

### Active vs. Passive Voice

**Generally prefer active:**
- Active: The detective found the clue.
- Passive: The clue was found by the detective.

**But passive is appropriate when:**
- The receiver is more important than the doer
- The doer is unknown or irrelevant
- Varying sentence structure intentionally
- It's natural for character voice

## Paragraph-Level Work

### Paragraph Purpose

Each paragraph should:
- Contain one main idea or action unit
- Connect logically to surrounding paragraphs
- Serve a clear function in the scene
- Have appropriate length for content

### Paragraph Openings

Strong paragraphs often open with:
- Topic sentence (non-fiction) or action (fiction)
- New speaker (dialogue)
- Transition from previous content
- Hook to draw reader forward

### Paragraph Flow

Within paragraphs:
- Ideas connect logically
- Transitions are smooth but not overworked
- Rhythm builds appropriately
- Final sentence lands with weight

### Paragraph Breaks

Add breaks for:
- New idea or action
- New speaker
- Shift in time or place
- Pacing control (more breaks = faster pace)
- Emphasis (short paragraph stands out)

## Word Choice

### Precision

**Goal:** The right word, not just a word

**Questions to ask:**
- Is this the most accurate word?
- Does this word carry the right connotations?
- Is this word appropriate for the register?
- Could a more specific word serve better?

**Example:**
| Generic | Precise |
|---------|---------|
| walked | shuffled, strode, crept, marched |
| said | murmured, shouted, whispered, announced |
| nice | elegant, pleasant, kind, attractive |

### Repetition

**Unintentional repetition problems:**
- Same word multiple times in close proximity
- Same sentence structure repeatedly
- Same opening word for multiple sentences
- Echo words (similar sounds)

**Intentional repetition uses:**
- Emphasis
- Rhythm
- Literary effect
- Callback

**The test:** Was this repetition a choice or an oversight?

### Register Consistency

**Register:** The level of formality/informality

**Must match:**
- Character voice
- Narrator voice
- Genre expectations
- Scene tone

**Watch for:**
- Jarring register shifts
- Overly formal in casual contexts
- Overly casual in serious contexts
- Modern language in historical settings

## Dialogue Refinement

### Dialogue Flow

Good dialogue:
- Sounds like speech (but better)
- Moves at appropriate pace
- Reveals character through speech patterns
- Advances story or character

**Trim:**
- Greetings and pleasantries (unless purposeful)
- Realistic filler ("um," "well," "so") unless characterizing
- On-the-nose statements of theme
- Information dumps

### Dialogue Tags

**Simple is usually better:**
- "said" and "asked" are invisible (usually good)
- Use action beats for variety
- Unusual tags ("ejaculated," "expostulated") distract
- Adverbs on tags often redundant

**Tag placement:**
- Before dialogue: Sets up speaker
- Mid-dialogue: Creates pause
- After dialogue: Default position
- None: When speaker is clear

### Subtext

**Dialogue is most effective when:**
- Characters don't say exactly what they mean
- What's unsaid matters
- Tension exists between words and meaning
- Readers can read between lines

## Description Refinement

### Effective Description

Description should:
- Serve story purpose (not just set-dressing)
- Integrate with action (avoid full stops for description)
- Use specific, concrete details
- Engage multiple senses when appropriate
- Match POV character's perspective

### Description Pitfalls

**Overwriting:**
- Too many adjectives/adverbs
- Purple prose (overwrought language)
- Trying too hard to be "literary"
- Description that calls attention to itself

**Underwriting:**
- White room syndrome (no setting)
- Missing sensory grounding
- Telling when showing would work
- Generic descriptions

### The "Camera" Test

Ask: "Could a camera see/hear this?"
- "She was angry" → Camera can't see this (internal)
- "She slammed the door" → Camera can see this (external)

Both have uses; know which you're employing.

## Voice Preservation

### Before Editing

1. Read a substantial sample
2. Identify voice characteristics:
   - Sentence rhythm patterns
   - Vocabulary level and preferences
   - Tone and humor style
   - Narrative distance
   - Distinctive stylistic choices

3. Note intentional "rule-breaking"
4. Create voice reference points

### During Editing

**Ask for each change:**
- Does this sound like this author?
- Am I correcting or replacing?
- Is this change necessary or preferential?
- Would the author recognize their work?

### When in Doubt

- Query rather than change
- Suggest rather than impose
- Return to voice reference points
- Prioritize preservation over "improvement"

## Line Editing Process

### Preparation

1. Complete developmental work first
2. Review voice characteristics
3. Set up style sheet (if not already)
4. Prepare tracking method

### Execution

1. Work section by section
2. Read aloud (or "hear" sentences)
3. Mark issues and suggestions
4. Query unclear decisions
5. Track patterns for global notes

### Review

1. Check changes against voice
2. Verify improvements are improvements
3. Organize feedback by priority
4. Prepare summary of patterns

## Common Line Editing Marks

| Mark/Note | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Awkward | Sentence reads clumsily; needs rewording |
| Clarity | Meaning unclear; needs clarification |
| Cut | Remove (explain if not obvious) |
| Echo | Unintended repetition |
| Word choice | Consider alternate word |
| Passive | Consider active voice |
| Show | Can this be shown rather than told? |
| Cliché | Overused phrase; freshen |
| Transition | Connection between ideas unclear |
