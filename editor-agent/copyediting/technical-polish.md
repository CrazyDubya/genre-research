- Prose style is established

### The Copyeditor's Mindset

- Systematic thoroughness
- Attention to detail
- Consistency obsession
- Rule knowledge and application

## Grammar

### Core Grammar Issues

**Subject-Verb Agreement:**
- The team is (collective = singular)
- The players are (individuals = plural)
- Neither she nor they are (compound = closer noun)

**Pronoun Agreement:**
- Everyone brought their book (acceptable in modern usage)
- Each student has his or her book (traditional)
- Document project style and apply consistently

**Tense Consistency:**
- Maintain chosen tense throughout
- Watch for shifts in flashbacks
- Narration tense vs. dialogue tense

**Parallel Structure:**
- Items in lists should match grammatically
- Comparisons should be structured alike
- Coordinate elements should parallel

### Common Grammar Errors

| Error | Incorrect | Correct |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Dangling modifier | Running quickly, the door slammed shut. | Running quickly, she slammed the door. |
| Misplaced modifier | She almost drove every mile. | She drove almost every mile. |
| Split infinitive | to boldly go | to go boldly (traditional) or to boldly go (modern acceptable) |
| Who/whom | Who did you give it to? | To whom did you give it? (formal) / Who did you give it to? (informal) |

### Grammar Style Decisions

Document project choices on:
- Serial comma usage
- Singular "they"
- Split infinitives
- Sentence fragments (intentional)
- Starting sentences with "And" or "But"

## Punctuation

### Comma Rules

**Use commas:**
- Before coordinating conjunctions in compound sentences
- After introductory elements
- Around non-essential clauses
- In series (style-dependent for final comma)
- Before direct address

**Common comma errors:**
- Comma splice (joining independent clauses with only comma)
- Missing comma after introductory phrase
- Comma between subject and verb
- Comma before "because" (usually wrong)

### Punctuation with Dialogue

**Standard US:**
- "Text," she said. (comma inside quotes)
- "Text!" she exclaimed. (exclamation inside)
- "Text?" she asked. (question inside)
- She said, "Text." (comma before quote)

**Dialogue with action:**
- "Text." She sat down. (period, new sentence)
- "Text"—she hesitated—"more text." (em dashes for interruption)

### Specialized Punctuation

**Em Dash (—):**
- Interruption or break in thought
- Emphasis
- Appositive with commas inside
- No spaces around (US style)

**En Dash (–):**
- Ranges (1990–2000)
- Compound adjectives with multi-word elements (post–World War II era)

**Ellipsis (...):**
- Trailing off
- Omission
- Hesitation
- Spaced or unspaced (per style guide)

### Hyphenation

**Hyphenate:**
- Compound adjectives before nouns (well-known author)
- Prefixes before proper nouns (un-American)
- To avoid confusion (re-creation vs. recreation)
- Numbers twenty-one through ninety-nine

**Don't hyphenate:**
- Compound adjectives after nouns (the author is well known)
- Adverb + adjective compounds (highly regarded work)
- When clear without hyphen

## Spelling and Usage

### Spelling Consistency

**Document and enforce:**
- US vs. UK spelling (color/colour)
- Variant spellings (donut/doughnut)
- Made-up words in fiction
- Specialized terminology

**Common confusions:**
| Word | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| affect/effect | verb/noun (usually) |
| lay/lie | transitive/intransitive |
| farther/further | physical/abstract |
| who's/whose | contraction/possessive |
| it's/its | contraction/possessive |

### Usage Issues

**Often confused:**
- fewer/less (countable/uncountable)
- that/which (restrictive/non-restrictive)
- may/might (possibility levels)
- can/may (ability/permission)
- among/between (more than two/two)

## Style Guide Application

### Style Guide Hierarchy

1. **Publisher requirements** (if specified)
2. **Project-specific style sheet** (document decisions)
3. **Standard style guide** (Chicago, AP, etc.)
4. **Copyeditor judgment** (when guides conflict or don't address)

### Creating a Style Sheet

Document:
- Character names (full, nicknames, spelling)
- Place names
- Timeline markers
- Unusual words/spellings
- Style decisions made
- Intentional rule-breaks
- Number styling (when to spell out)
- Capitalization choices

### Common Style Decisions

**Numbers:**
- Spell out zero through one hundred (Chicago)
- Spell out zero through nine (AP)
- Always numeral with units
- Never start sentence with numeral

**Capitalization:**
- Title case rules
- Proper noun decisions
- In-world terms (magic system, titles)
- After colons (style-dependent)

**Formatting:**
- Italics for emphasis, titles, foreign words
- Quotation marks for dialogue, scare quotes
- Bold usage (if any)
- Scene break markers

## Consistency Enforcement

### Cross-Reference Verification

**Character details:**
- Physical descriptions
- Ages
- Backstory facts
- Relationships
- Speech patterns

**Setting details:**
- Geography
- Layout of spaces
- Weather/seasons
- Time of day

**Plot details:**
- Timeline
- Cause-effect chains
- Who knows what when
- Object locations

### Consistency Tracking Methods

**Running style sheet:**
- Update as you go
- Include page/chapter references
- Flag uncertain items
- Cross-reference related items

**Character cards:**
- Physical description
- Key facts
- Chapter appearances
- Notable actions/statements

**Timeline:**
- Day/time markers
- Event sequence
- Character locations through time
- Season/weather markers

## Fact Checking

### What to Verify

- Historical facts
- Geographic accuracy
- Technical accuracy
- Cultural facts
- Name spellings (real people)
- Titles and quotes (from real sources)

### Verification Approach

1. Flag questionable facts
2. Query author if uncertain
3. Verify basic factual claims
4. Note unverifiable claims
5. Document verification method

### Sensitivity Flags

Note for further review:
- Cultural representation
- Historical sensitivity
- Legal concerns
- Potentially harmful content
- Factual claims that could cause problems if wrong
