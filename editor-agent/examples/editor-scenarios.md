# Editor Scenarios

Practical examples of applying editorial protocols in various situations.

## Scenario 1: Developmental Assessment

### Situation
You receive a first draft of a contemporary romance (80,000 words) for developmental assessment. Initial read reveals strong voice but structural issues with pacing and underdeveloped subplots.

### Editor Actions

#### Step 1: Complete First Read

Read without heavy marking. Note reactions:

```
FIRST READ NOTES:

Strong elements:
- Voice is distinctive and charming
- Chemistry between leads is excellent
- Dialogue is snappy and character-revealing
- Meet-cute is genuinely funny (Ch. 2)
- Black moment is emotionally powerful (Ch. 20)

Concerns:
- Act Two sags significantly (Ch. 10-16)
- Secondary romance subplot disappears for 5 chapters
- Career subplot resolved too easily
- Pacing inconsistent - some chapters feel rushed
- Third-act conflict feels manufactured
```

#### Step 2: Structural Analysis

Map the structure:

```
ACT ONE (Ch. 1-6, ~20,000 words): WORKS
- Setup: Strong
- Inciting incident: Meet-cute Ch. 2, effective
- First plot point: Ch. 6, good transition

ACT TWO (Ch. 7-19, ~50,000 words): ISSUES
- First half (Ch. 7-12): Strong
- Midpoint shift (Ch. 12): Present but weak
- Second half (Ch. 13-18): SAGS - pacing issues
- Crisis (Ch. 19): Effective emotionally

ACT THREE (Ch. 20-25, ~10,000 words): MIXED
- Black moment: Strong
- Resolution: Rushed
- Ending: Satisfying but quick
```

#### Step 3: Write Developmental Letter

```
Dear [Writer],

Thank you for the opportunity to work on [Title]. After a complete read
and structural analysis, I'm excited about this manuscript's potential.
The voice is fresh and engaging, and the central relationship crackles
with chemistry.

WHAT'S WORKING

Your greatest strengths here are voice and relationship development.
The leads' banter is genuinely witty, and their chemistry develops
believably. The meet-cute (Ch. 2) had me laughing out loud, and the
black moment (Ch. 20) is emotionally devastating in the best way.

STRUCTURAL OBSERVATIONS

The manuscript follows solid three-act structure, but Act Two, particularly
Chapters 13-18, needs attention. Currently, the middle section loses
momentum as the subplots thin and the romantic conflict repeats rather
than escalates.

Specific recommendations:

1. MIDPOINT STRENGTHENING (Ch. 12)
Current: They share a meaningful conversation.
Recommended: Increase stakes—perhaps a forced proximity situation or
external event that changes their dynamic. The midpoint should feel
like a point of no return.

2. ACT TWO PACING (Ch. 13-18)
These chapters cover similar emotional territory repeatedly. Consider:
- Combining or cutting repetitive scenes
- Adding external plot pressure
- Developing the career subplot through this section
- Bringing the secondary romance back into view

3. SECONDARY ROMANCE SUBPLOT
Maya and Jordan's storyline disappears entirely from Ch. 10-15.
This subplot can serve as contrast/mirror to the main romance.
Thread their story through the middle to maintain reader engagement
and provide pacing relief.

4. CAREER RESOLUTION
The career problem resolves too conveniently in Ch. 22. This undermines
the competent protagonist you've built. Consider making her more active
in solving it, perhaps integrating it with the romantic resolution.

5. ENDING EXPANSION
The final two chapters feel rushed. After the emotional journey,
readers want to savor the resolution. Consider adding 2,000-3,000 words
to the ending: more reunion scene, perhaps an epilogue glimpse.

PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS

1. [CRITICAL] Restructure Ch. 13-18 to maintain momentum
2. [HIGH] Strengthen midpoint stakes
3. [HIGH] Thread Maya/Jordan subplot through Act Two
4. [MEDIUM] Revise career subplot resolution
5. [MEDIUM] Expand ending

NEXT STEPS

I recommend revising based on structural feedback before line editing.
The prose itself is strong; polishing it before the structure is set
would waste effort on scenes that may change significantly.

Happy to discuss any of this in more detail.

Best,
[Editor]

## Scenario 2: Line Editing with Voice Preservation

### Situation
You're line editing a literary fiction manuscript. The author has a distinctive, lyrical voice that occasionally becomes unclear. Your challenge: improve clarity without flattening the voice.

### Editor Actions

#### Step 1: Establish Voice Baseline

```
VOICE PROFILE:

SENTENCE PATTERNS:
- Long, flowing sentences with multiple clauses
- Strategic short sentences for emphasis
- Frequent em-dashes for parenthetical thoughts
- Periodic use of fragments

VOCABULARY:
- Literary but accessible
- Nature imagery throughout
- Avoids contemporary slang
- Occasional archaic word choices (intentional)

DISTINCTIVE PATTERNS:
- Delayed subjects ("There was, in the way she spoke, a melody")
- Extended metaphors across paragraphs
- Second-person intrusions for universality
- Lists of three with variation

SAMPLE:
"The morning came as mornings do in that part of the country—slow
and uncertain, the light filtering through pine as if asking permission
to enter. She watched it, this tentative dawn, and thought: this is
how love arrives too."
```

#### Step 2: Edit with Voice in Mind

**Original passage with clarity issues:**
"He thought about the way that she had been speaking to him, in the
kitchen, with the light coming through the window and falling across
her face in ways that made him remember other times, other kitchens
perhaps, though he couldn't say which ones exactly, and the feeling
of loss that came with that not-knowing was itself a kind of presence
in the room."

**Editor's analysis:**
This sentence is 75 words—long even for this voice. The nested clauses
lose the reader. But the sentiment and approach are characteristic.
Don't flatten; clarify.

**Edited version (suggested):**
"He thought about the way she'd been speaking to him in the kitchen,
the light falling across her face and calling up other times, other
kitchens—though which ones, he couldn't say. That not-knowing carried
its own weight, a presence in the room as real as the two of them."

**Editorial note:**
"This long sentence may lose readers in the nested clauses. I've
suggested breaking it while maintaining your characteristic rhythm
and the em-dash parenthetical. The revision preserves the dreamlike
quality while improving clarity. Please adjust to your ear if this
version doesn't feel right—I want to serve your voice, not replace it."

## Scenario 3: Continuity Error Discovery

### Situation
During copyediting, you discover a significant continuity error: the protagonist's sister dies in Chapter 8, but the protagonist mentions talking to her sister in Chapter 15.

### Editor Actions

#### Step 1: Document the Error

```
CONTINUITY ERROR

LOCATION: Chapter 15, page 203

TEXT: "She called her sister that evening, needing to hear a
familiar voice."

CONFLICT: Chapter 8, pages 98-102

The sister (Marie) dies in Chapter 8. The funeral scene is in
Chapter 9. Multiple references to grief appear in Chapters 10-14.

This cannot be a phone call to a living person.

POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS:
1. Error - author forgot
2. The dying character was misidentified (not the sister)
3. There's another sister not previously mentioned
4. Supernatural element (ghost communication)
5. Flashback not clearly marked
```

#### Step 2: Query the Author

```
AUTHOR QUERY: Chapter 15, page 203

There's a continuity concern here. The protagonist calls her sister
in this chapter, but Marie died in Chapter 8.

Is this:
A) An error to be corrected
B) A different sister (please clarify name/relationship)
C) A flashback that needs temporal marking
D) Intentional (please explain so I understand)

If A: Would you like to revise, or shall I suggest alternative
text? She might call [another character] or the scene could be
revised to show her grief that she can't call Marie.
```

#### Step 3: Flag Related References

```
CONTINUITY TRACKING NOTE:

If this is corrected (Marie is dead), verify:
- Ch. 16: Reference to "talking to family" (p. 215)
- Ch. 18: "Her sister's advice came back to her" (p. 234) - could
  be memory; fine as-is
- Ch. 22: "She wished she could call Marie" (p. 278) - consistent
  with death

Only p. 203 appears to be an error. The other references work
with Marie being deceased.
```

## Scenario 4: Over-Editing Catch

### Situation
You're reviewing your own line edit before returning the manuscript. You notice you've been systematically changing the author's sentence structures to match your preferences rather than correcting actual problems.

### Editor Actions

#### Step 1: Recognize the Pattern

You've changed:
- "She thought about what he said" → "His words occupied her thoughts"
- Multiple instances of similar restructuring
- Changes that are different, not better
- Author's voice being replaced with your style

#### Step 2: Self-Correct

```
SELF-REVIEW NOTE:

I've been over-editing. The changes on pages 45-78 often impose
my preference for inverted sentence structure rather than correcting
genuine issues.

TEST QUESTION: "Would the author recognize their work?"
For many of my changes, the answer is no.

ACTION: Review all changes in this section. Revert those that:
- Don't fix an actual problem
- Replace voice rather than refine it
- Impose my style preferences
- Change without improving
```

#### Step 3: Establish Self-Check Protocol

Going forward, before each change, ask:
1. Is there an actual problem here?
2. Is this a correction or a preference?
3. Does the change preserve authorial voice?
4. Would a general reader be confused by the original?
5. Is this change necessary or just different?

#### Step 4: Document in Editorial Notes

"Note: During my review, I noticed some changes in the middle
section may have been preferential rather than necessary. I've
reverted several and apologize for any overreach. Please stet
anything else that feels like my voice rather than yours."

## Scenario 5: Conflicting Style Choices

### Situation
The manuscript inconsistently uses "grey" and "gray," "toward" and "towards," and the serial comma. The author used all variations throughout. You need to establish and apply consistency.

### Editor Actions

#### Step 1: Count Occurrences

```
CONSISTENCY ANALYSIS:

grey: 23 instances
gray: 18 instances

toward: 31 instances
towards: 12 instances

Serial comma used: ~60% of lists
Serial comma omitted: ~40% of lists
```

#### Step 2: Make Style Decisions

```
STYLE DECISIONS:

grey/gray:
- More instances of "grey"
- Setting is US, author is US
- DECISION: Standardize to "gray" (US convention)
- Exception: If a character is British, retain "grey" in their
  dialogue/POV

toward/towards:
- Strong preference for "toward"
- DECISION: Standardize to "toward"

Serial comma:
- Slight majority uses it
- Less ambiguity with it
- DECISION: Use serial comma consistently
```

#### Step 3: Document and Apply

```
STYLE SHEET ADDITIONS:

Spelling:
- gray (not grey) - except British characters
- toward (not towards)

Punctuation:
- Serial comma: Yes, always in lists of three or more
```

#### Step 4: Communicate Decision

"Style note: I've standardized spelling (gray, toward) and
punctuation (serial comma) per the attached style sheet. These
were used inconsistently in the manuscript; I chose based on
majority usage and US conventions. Please let me know if you
have strong preferences otherwise."
