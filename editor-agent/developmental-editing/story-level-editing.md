# Story-Level Editing

Developmental editing addresses the big-picture elements of a manuscript: structure, plot, character, pacing, and theme. This guide covers systematic approaches to story-level assessment and improvement.

## The Developmental Editor's Focus

### What Developmental Editing Addresses

- **Structure:** Overall organization, act structure, scene sequence
- **Plot:** Story logic, cause-and-effect, conflict progression
- **Character:** Arc development, motivation, consistency
- **Pacing:** Momentum, tension curves, reader engagement
- **Theme:** Underlying meaning, coherence, integration
- **Stakes:** What's at risk, escalation, investment drivers

### What It Doesn't Address (Yet)

- Sentence-level prose quality
- Grammar and punctuation
- Word choice refinement
- Minor inconsistencies
- Formatting issues

## Structural Analysis

### Act Structure Assessment

For three-act structure:

**Act One (Setup) - Typically 20-25%**
- [ ] World/situation introduced
- [ ] Protagonist introduced with sympathy and goal
- [ ] Normal world established (to contrast with change)
- [ ] Inciting incident present and effective
- [ ] Stakes introduced
- [ ] First plot point transitions into Act Two

**Act Two (Confrontation) - Typically 50-55%**
- [ ] Protagonist actively pursuing goal
- [ ] Obstacles increasing in difficulty
- [ ] Midpoint shift/revelation present
- [ ] Character development ongoing
- [ ] Subplots advancing
- [ ] Stakes escalating
- [ ] Crisis/dark moment before Act Three

**Act Three (Resolution) - Typically 20-25%**
- [ ] Climax positioned correctly
- [ ] Protagonist drives resolution
- [ ] All major threads resolved
- [ ] Theme crystallized
- [ ] Ending satisfies story promises

### Scene Analysis

For each scene, verify:

**Purpose:** Does this scene serve at least one of:
- Advance plot
- Develop character
- Provide necessary information
- Create emotional experience

**Entry/Exit:** Does the scene:
- Start as late as possible
- End as early as possible
- Hook into next scene

**Conflict:** Does the scene contain:
- Some form of tension or conflict
- Character wanting something
- Obstacle or complication

### Chapter Analysis

For each chapter:
- [ ] Clear purpose for inclusion
- [ ] Appropriate length for genre
- [ ] Effective opening hook
- [ ] Strong ending (cliffhanger/revelation/decision)
- [ ] Logical placement in sequence

## Plot Analysis

### Story Logic Verification

**Cause and Effect:**
- Every effect has a clear cause
- Every cause has consequences
- Actions stem from character motivation
- Coincidences are minimized (especially to rescue protagonist)

**Information Management:**
- Readers have information needed to follow
- Reveals timed for maximum impact
- Foreshadowing present for major developments
- Chekhov's guns (setups) are fired (paid off)

**Conflict Progression:**
| Act | Conflict Level |
|-----|----------------|
| Beginning of Act One | Low - Status quo |
| Inciting Incident | Rising - Problem introduced |
| End of Act One | Committed - No going back |
| Midpoint | Shifted - New understanding |
| End of Act Two | Peak - All seems lost |
| Climax | Resolution - Final confrontation |
| End | Settled - New equilibrium |

### Plot Hole Detection

**Common plot holes:**
- Character knows something they shouldn't
- Character doesn't know something they should
- Physical impossibilities (distance, timing)
- Unexplained character decisions
- Dropped plot threads
- Contradictory information

**Detection method:**
1. Create story timeline
2. Track character knowledge states
3. Note physical movements and timing
4. Follow each plot thread to resolution
5. Verify all setups have payoffs

### Stakes Assessment

**Questions to verify stakes:**
- What happens if the protagonist fails?
- Why should the reader care?
- Do stakes escalate appropriately?
- Are stakes both external and internal?
- Is the worst outcome truly threatening?

## Character Analysis

### Protagonist Assessment

**Character fundamentals:**
- [ ] Clear goal (external and internal)
- [ ] Understandable motivation
- [ ] Relatable flaw or wound
- [ ] Likable or at least compelling qualities
- [ ] Agency (drives the plot, not driven by it)

**Character arc:**
- [ ] Starting state clear
- [ ] Transformation catalysts present
- [ ] Growth demonstrated through action
- [ ] Setbacks and struggles included
- [ ] End state earned and clear

### Supporting Character Assessment

For each significant character:
- [ ] Serves story function
- [ ] Distinguishable from other characters
- [ ] Consistent characterization
- [ ] Appropriate screen time for role
- [ ] Enhances rather than distracts from main story

### Antagonist Assessment

- [ ] Clear, understandable motivation
- [ ] Genuine threat to protagonist
- [ ] Complexity beyond "evil for evil's sake"
- [ ] Active rather than passive
- [ ] Worthy opponent

### Relationship Development

For key relationships:
- [ ] Development shown, not just told
- [ ] Changes feel earned
- [ ] Conflict appropriate to relationship
- [ ] Moments of connection included
- [ ] Arc conclusion satisfying

## Pacing Analysis

### Pacing Assessment

**Warning signs of pacing problems:**

*Too slow:*
- Excessive description
- Repetitive internal monologue
- Scenes that don't advance anything
- Too much setup before action
- Lengthy transitions

*Too fast:*
- Insufficient character development
- Emotional moments not given space
- Information dumps instead of reveals
- Scene transitions without orientation
- Major events without impact processing

### Tension Management

Tension should:
- Vary (cannot be constant)
- Generally increase toward climax
- Release appropriately after major sequences
- Build within scenes, not just across them
- Match reader expectations for genre

### Scene-Level Pacing

Within scenes:
- Action/dialogue balanced with reflection
- Sentence rhythm matches content
- Tension builds toward scene climax
- Breathing room after intensity

## Theme Analysis

### Theme Identification

**Questions to identify theme:**
- What is this story really about?
- What question does it explore?
- What truth does it illuminate?
- What change does the protagonist's journey represent?

### Theme Integration

Theme should:
- Emerge from story events (not be stated explicitly)
- Connect to protagonist's arc
- Be explored through multiple characters/subplots
- Avoid preachiness
- Allow for complexity (not simple answers)

## Developmental Feedback

### The Developmental Letter

A developmental edit typically includes a detailed letter covering:

1. **Overall Assessment**
   - What's working well
   - Core story appeal
   - General impressions

2. **Structural Feedback**
   - Act structure analysis
   - Pacing observations
   - Scene/chapter recommendations

3. **Plot Feedback**
   - Logic issues
   - Stakes assessment
   - Conflict progression

4. **Character Feedback**
   - Protagonist effectiveness
   - Character arc observations
   - Relationship dynamics

5. **Specific Recommendations**
   - Priority issues to address
   - Suggested approaches
   - Questions for consideration

### Prioritizing Developmental Feedback

**Critical (Must Address):**
- Plot holes that break story logic
- Missing/ineffective protagonist arc
- Structural problems that undermine narrative
- Stakes failures

**Important (Should Address):**
- Pacing issues
- Character inconsistencies
- Underdeveloped relationships
- Weak scenes

**Suggested (Consider):**
- Theme strengthening
- Subplot enhancements
- Additional character development
- Scene order adjustments

## Developmental Editing Process

### Step 1: First Read

- Note your reactions as a reader
- Track engagement levels
- Don't analyze; experience

### Step 2: Analysis
- Complete structural analysis
- Identify plot issues
- Assess characters
- Evaluate pacing
- Note theme

### Step 3: Synthesis
- Prioritize findings
- Identify patterns
- Develop recommendations
- Draft developmental letter

### Step 4: Delivery
- Lead with strengths
- Organize by priority
- Be specific and actionable
- Offer support
