# Line-Edit Suggestions with Toggles

Generate line edits with configurable focus areas. Use toggles to request specific types of edits.

## Toggles

- **Clarity**: eliminate ambiguity, simplify structure, resolve confusing references.
- **Rhythm**: improve sentence cadence, vary length, reduce monotony.
- **Concision**: remove redundancy and filler without changing meaning.

## Output Format

Provide edits in this format:

```
[Clarity] Original → Revised
Rationale: ...

[Rhythm] Original → Revised
Rationale: ...
```

## Guidance

- Avoid changing plot facts or voice.
- Keep edits minimal and reversible.
- Preserve POV and tense.
- Limit to 5–10 edits per scene unless requested.

## Example

```
[Clarity] She looked at him, her eyes wide with fear, as the door opened. → She froze as the door opened, eyes wide with fear.
Rationale: Removes redundancy and clarifies the subject’s action.

[Concision] He began to walk down the long hallway toward the exit. → He walked down the hallway toward the exit.
Rationale: Removes unnecessary auxiliary verb.
```
