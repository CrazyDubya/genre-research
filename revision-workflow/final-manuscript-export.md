# Final Manuscript Compilation & Export

Use this guide to assemble the final manuscript and export in DOCX, EPUB, or Markdown.

## Compilation Steps

1. **Lock content** after Prose Polish.
2. **Normalize formatting**
   - Consistent scene breaks (e.g., `***`).
   - Standardize headings, chapter numbers, and epigraphs.
3. **Run final continuity and spelling checks**.
4. **Generate export-ready files**.

## Formatting Standards

- **Chapters**: `# Chapter N` or `## Chapter N`.
- **Scene breaks**: `***` on its own line.
- **Emphasis**: use italics for inner thought; avoid inline bold.
- **Dialogue**: use em dash or ellipses consistently.
