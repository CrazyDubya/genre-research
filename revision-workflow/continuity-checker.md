# Continuity Checker (Timeline + Canon)

Use this checklist to validate consistency across the manuscript.

## Inputs

- **Timeline**: chronological event list (date/time or sequence number).
- **Canon**: immutable facts (names, rules, locations, technology, backstory).
- **Draft**: manuscript or scene list.

## Method

1. **Map scenes to timeline**
   - Assign each scene a timestamp or sequence number.
   - Record who is present and what they know.
2. **Cross-check canon facts**
   - Verify names, titles, spellings.
   - Validate world rules and constraints.
3. **Validate logistics**
   - Travel times, distances, and schedules.
   - Physical constraints (injuries, weather, resources).

## Continuity Checks

### Timeline Integrity
- [ ] No two events require the same character in two places at once.
- [ ] Cause precedes effect (no reverse causality).
- [ ] Time gaps are plausible for travel/actions.
- [ ] Day/night cycle aligns with scene descriptions.

### Canon Consistency
- [ ] Names/titles remain stable.
- [ ] Rules of the world are never violated.
- [ ] Character histories remain consistent.
- [ ] Locations and geography do not shift.

### Knowledge Tracking
- [ ] Characters only act on information they have.
- [ ] Information reveals occur before use.
- [ ] Secrets remain secret until disclosed.
