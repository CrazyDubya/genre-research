## Key Principles of Epic / Space Opera

### **1. Plan Your Series**

**Know before writing Book 1:**
- Where does series conclude?
- What happens in each book?
- Where do characters start and end?
- **Why:** Can't plant seeds if you don't know what grows

### **2. Each Book Must Satisfy**

**Each book needs:**
- Complete arc (setup, confrontation, resolution)
- Advance series arc
- Develop characters
- Expand world
- **Balance:** Not just setup for next book, not completely self-contained

### **3. Character Is More Important Than Scope**

**Epic scope means nothing if reader doesn't care about characters.**

**Create characters readers care about:**
- Flaws and strengths
- Clear goals and needs
- Vulnerability
- Growth across series

### **4. Reveal, Don't Dump**

**Give reader what they need, when they need it.**

**Reveal strategy:**
- Book 1: Core world
- Books 2-3: Expansion
- Final books: Deepest secrets

### **5. Escalate Stakes**

**Each book must top previous.**

**Types of escalation:**
- Geographic: Region → world → galaxy
- Character: Personal → community → world → reality
- Knowledge: Surface truth → deeper truth → full truth
- Stakes: Save self → save kingdom → save world → save reality

## Common Epic / Space Opera Problems

### **Problem: Info-Dumping**
- **Symptom:** Long passages explaining history/world
- **Solution:** Reveal gradually through story, only what reader needs now

### **Problem: Too Many POVs**
- **Symptom:** Reader can't track dozens of characters
- **Solution:** Limit active POVs (3-5 main per book), distinct voices

### **Problem: Middle Books Drag**
- **Symptom:** Books 3-4 feel slow or unfocused
- **Solution:** Each book has own conflict/arc, vary stakes and focus

### **Problem: Character Inconsistency**
- **Symptom:** Characters act differently across books
- **Solution:** Character profiles, re-read previous books, growth must be earned

### **Problem: Series Loses Focus**
- **Symptom:** Later books feel scattered
- **Solution:** Use series bible, re-read previous books, beta readers

### **Problem: Unanswered Questions**
- **Symptom:** Series concludes but questions remain
- **Solution:** Plan endings from start, track questions, ensure resolution
